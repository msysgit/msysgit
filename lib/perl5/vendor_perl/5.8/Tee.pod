=head1 NAME

Tee - Pure Perl emulation of GNU tee

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.13

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # from Perl
  use Tee;
  tee( $command, @files );
 
  # from the command line
  $ cat README.txt | ptee COPY.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<<< Tee >>> distribution provides the L<ptee> program, a pure Perl emulation of
the standard GNU tool C<<< tee >>>.  It is designed to be a platform-independent
replacement for operating systems without a native C<<< tee >>> program.  As with
C<<< tee >>>, it passes input received on STDIN through to STDOUT while also writing a
copy of the input to one or more files.  By default, files will be overwritten.

Unlike C<<< tee >>>, C<<< ptee >>> does not support ignoring interrupts, as signal handling
is not sufficiently portable.

The C<<< Tee >>> module provides a convenience function that may be used in place of
C<<< system() >>> to redirect commands through C<<< ptee >>>. 

=head1 USAGE

=head2 C<<< tee() >>>

   tee( $command, @filenames );
   tee( $command, \%options, @filenames );

Executes the given command via C<<< system() >>>, but pipes it through L<ptee> to copy
output to the list of files.  Unlike with C<<< system() >>>, the command must be a
string as the command shell is used for redirection and piping.  The return
value of C<<< system() >>> is passed through, but reflects the success of 
the C<<< ptee >>> command, which isn't very useful.

The second argument may be a hash-reference of options.  Recognized options
include:

=over

=item *

stderr -- redirects STDERR to STDOUT before piping to L<ptee> (default: false)

=item *

append -- passes the C<<< -a >>> flag to L<ptee> to append instead of overwriting
(default: false)

=back

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Because of the way that C<<< Tee >>> uses pipes, it is limited to capturing a single
input stream, either STDOUT alone or both STDOUT and STDERR combined.  A good,
portable alternative for capturing these streams from a command separately is
L<IPC::Run3>, though it does not allow passing it through to a terminal at the
same time.
