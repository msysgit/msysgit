This directory contains binary encoding maps for some selected encodings.
If they are placed in a directoy listed in @XML::Parser::Expat::Encoding_Path,
then they are automaticly loaded by the XML::Parser::Expat::load_encoding
function as needed. Otherwise you may load what you need directly by
explicity calling this function.

These maps were generated by a perl script that comes with the module
XML::Encoding, compile_encoding, from XML formatted encoding maps that
are distributed with that module. These XML encoding maps were generated
in turn with a different script, domap, from mapping information contained
on the Unicode version 2.0 CD-ROM. This CD-ROM comes with the Unicode
Standard reference manual and can be ordered from the Unicode Consortium
at http://www.unicode.org. The identical information is available on the
internet at ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS.

See the encoding.h header in the Expat sub-directory for a description of
the structure of these files.

Contributed maps

This distribution contains four contributed encodings from MURATA Makoto
<murata@apsdc.ksp.fujixerox.co.jp> that are variations on the encoding
commonly called Shift_JIS:

x-sjis-cp932.enc
x-sjis-jdk117.enc
x-sjis-jisx0221.enc
x-sjis-unicode.enc	(This is the same encoding as the shift_jis.enc that
			 was distributed with this module in version 2.17)

Please read his message (Japanese_Encodings.msg) about why these are here
and why I've removed the shift_jis.enc encoding.

We also have two contributed encodings that are variations of the EUC-JP
encoding from Yoshida Masato <yoshidam@inse.co.jp>:

x-euc-jp-jisx0221.enc
x-euc-jp-unicode.enc

The comments that MURATA Makoto made in his message apply to these
encodings too.

KangChan Lee <dolphin@comeng.chungnam.ac.kr> supplied the euc-kr encoding.
