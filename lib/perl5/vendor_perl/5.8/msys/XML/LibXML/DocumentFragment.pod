=head1 NAME

XML::LibXML::DocumentFragment - XML::LibXML's DOM L2 Document Fragment Implementation

This class is a helper class as described in the DOM Level 2 Specification. It
is implemented as a node without name. All adding, inserting or replacing
functions are aware of document fragments now.

As well all unbound nodes (all nodes that do not belong to any document
sub-tree) are implicit members of document fragments.
