# Warning: Only the variation sequences specifically defined in this file

#
# Format:
#   Field 0: the variation sequence
#   Field 1: the description of the desired appearance
#   Field 2: where the appearance is only different in in particular shaping environments
#	this field lists them. The possible values are: isolate, initial, medial, final.
#	If more than one is present, there are spaces between them.
