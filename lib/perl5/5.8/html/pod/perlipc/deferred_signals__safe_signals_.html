<h2><a name="deferred_signals__safe_signals_">Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)</a></h2>
<p>In Perls before Perl 5.7.3 by installing Perl code to deal with
signals, you were exposing yourself to danger from two things.  First,
few system library functions are re-entrant.  If the signal interrupts
while Perl is executing one function (like <code>malloc(3)</code> or printf(3)),
and your signal handler then calls the same function again, you could
get unpredictable behavior--often, a core dump.  Second, Perl isn't
itself re-entrant at the lowest levels.  If the signal interrupts Perl
while Perl is changing its own internal data structures, similarly
unpredictable behaviour may result.</p>
<p>There were two things you could do, knowing this: be paranoid or be
pragmatic.  The paranoid approach was to do as little as possible in your
signal handler.  Set an existing integer variable that already has a
value, and return.  This doesn't help you if you're in a slow system call,
which will just restart.  That means you have to <code>die</code> to <code>longjump(3)</code> out
of the handler.  Even this is a little cavalier for the true paranoiac,
who avoids <code>die</code> in a handler because the system <em>is</em> out to get you.
The pragmatic approach was to say ``I know the risks, but prefer the
convenience'', and to do anything you wanted in your signal handler,
and be prepared to clean up core dumps now and again.</p>
<p>In Perl 5.7.3 and later to avoid these problems signals are
``deferred''-- that is when the signal is delivered to the process by
the system (to the C code that implements Perl) a flag is set, and the
handler returns immediately. Then at strategic ``safe'' points in the
Perl interpreter (e.g. when it is about to execute a new opcode) the
flags are checked and the Perl level handler from %SIG is
executed. The ``deferred'' scheme allows much more flexibility in the
coding of signal handler as we know Perl interpreter is in a safe
state, and that we are not in a system library function when the
handler is called.  However the implementation does differ from
previous Perls in the following ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_long_running_opcodes">Long running opcodes</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>As Perl interpreter only looks at the signal flags when it about to
execute a new opcode if a signal arrives during a long running opcode
(e.g. a regular expression operation on a very large string) then
signal will not be seen until operation completes.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_interrupting_io">Interrupting IO</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>When a signal is delivered (e.g. INT control-C) the operating system
breaks into IO operations like <code>read</code> (used to implement Perls
&lt;&gt; operator). On older Perls the handler was called
immediately (and as <code>read</code> is not ``unsafe'' this worked well). With
the ``deferred'' scheme the handler is not called immediately, and if
Perl is using system's <code>stdio</code> library that library may re-start the
<code>read</code> without returning to Perl and giving it a chance to call the
%SIG handler. If this happens on your system the solution is to use
<code>:perlio</code> layer to do IO - at least on those handles which you want
to be able to break into with signals. (The <code>:perlio</code> layer checks
the signal flags and calls %SIG handlers before resuming IO operation.)</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Note that the default in Perl 5.7.3 and later is to automatically use
the <code>:perlio</code> layer.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Note that some networking library functions like <code>gethostbyname()</code> are
known to have their own implementations of timeouts which may conflict
with your timeouts.  If you are having problems with such functions,
you can try using the POSIX <code>sigaction()</code> function, which bypasses the
Perl safe signals (note that this means subjecting yourself to
possible memory corruption, as described above).  Instead of setting
<code>$SIG{ALRM}</code>:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die &quot;alarm&quot; };</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>try something like the following:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    use POSIX qw(SIGALRM);
    POSIX::sigaction(SIGALRM,
                     POSIX::SigAction-&gt;new(sub { die &quot;alarm&quot; }))
          or die &quot;Error setting SIGALRM handler: $!\n&quot;;</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_restartable_system_calls">Restartable system calls</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>On systems that supported it, older versions of Perl used the
SA_RESTART flag when installing %SIG handlers.  This meant that
restartable system calls would continue rather than returning when
a signal arrived.  In order to deliver deferred signals promptly,
Perl 5.7.3 and later do <em>not</em> use SA_RESTART.  Consequently, 
restartable system calls can fail (with $! set to <code>EINTR</code>) in places
where they previously would have succeeded.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Note that the default <code>:perlio</code> layer will retry <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>
and <code>close</code> as described above and that interrupted <code>wait</code> and 
<code>waitpid</code> calls will always be retried.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_signals_as__22faults_22">Signals as ``faults''</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Certain signals e.g. SEGV, ILL, BUS are generated as a result of
virtual memory or other ``faults''. These are normally fatal and there
is little a Perl-level handler can do with them. (In particular the
old signal scheme was particularly unsafe in such cases.)  However if
a %SIG handler is set the new scheme simply sets a flag and returns as
described above. This may cause the operating system to try the
offending machine instruction again and - as nothing has changed - it
will generate the signal again. The result of this is a rather odd
``loop''. In future Perl's signal mechanism may be changed to avoid this
- perhaps by simply disallowing %SIG handlers on signals of that
type. Until then the work-round is not to set a %SIG handler on those
signals. (Which signals they are is operating system dependent.)</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_signals_triggered_by_operating_system_state">Signals triggered by operating system state</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>On some operating systems certain signal handlers are supposed to ``do
something'' before returning. One example can be CHLD or CLD which
indicates a child process has completed. On some operating systems the
signal handler is expected to <code>wait</code> for the completed child
process. On such systems the deferred signal scheme will not work for
those signals (it does not do the <code>wait</code>). Again the failure will
look like a loop as the operating system will re-issue the signal as
there are un-waited-for completed child processes.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>If you want the old signal behaviour back regardless of possible
memory corruption, set the environment variable <code>PERL_SIGNALS</code> to
<code>&quot;unsafe&quot;</code> (a new feature since Perl 5.8.1).</p>
