<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>The normal way to run a Perl program is by making it directly
executable, or else by passing the name of the source file as an
argument on the command line.  (An interactive Perl environment
is also possible--see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perldebug.html">the perldebug manpage</a> for details on how to do that.)
Upon startup, Perl looks for your program in one of the following
places:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Specified line by line via <strong>-e</strong> switches on the command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line.
(Note that systems supporting the #! notation invoke interpreters this
way. See <a href="#location_of_perl">Location of Perl</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passed in implicitly via standard input.  This works only if there are
no filename arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN-read program you
must explicitly specify a ``-'' for the program name.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the
beginning, unless you've specified a <strong>-x</strong> switch, in which case it
scans for the first line starting with #! and containing the word
``perl'', and starts there instead.  This is useful for running a program
embedded in a larger message.  (In this case you would indicate the end
of the program using the <code>__END__</code> token.)</p>
<p>The #! line is always examined for switches as the line is being
parsed.  Thus, if you're on a machine that allows only one argument
with the #! line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the #! line, you
still can get consistent switch behavior regardless of how Perl was
invoked, even if <strong>-x</strong> was used to find the beginning of the program.</p>
<p>Because historically some operating systems silently chopped off
kernel interpretation of the #! line after 32 characters, some
switches may be passed in on the command line, and some may not;
you could even get a ``-'' without its letter, if you're not careful.
You probably want to make sure that all your switches fall either
before or after that 32-character boundary.  Most switches don't
actually care if they're processed redundantly, but getting a ``-''
instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to try to execute
standard input instead of your program.  And a partial <strong>-I</strong> switch
could also cause odd results.</p>
<p>Some switches do care if they are processed twice, for instance
combinations of <strong>-l</strong> and <strong>-0</strong>.  Either put all the switches after
the 32-character boundary (if applicable), or replace the use of
<strong>-0</strong><em>digits</em> by <code>BEGIN{ $/ = &quot;\0digits&quot;; }</code>.</p>
<p>Parsing of the #! switches starts wherever ``perl'' is mentioned in the line.
The sequences ``-*'' and ``- '' are specifically ignored so that you could,
if you were so inclined, say</p>
<pre>
    #!/bin/sh -- # -*- perl -*- -p
    eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
        if $running_under_some_shell;</pre>
<p>to let Perl see the <strong>-p</strong> switch.</p>
<p>A similar trick involves the <strong>env</strong> program, if you have it.</p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl</pre>
<p>The examples above use a relative path to the perl interpreter,
getting whatever version is first in the user's path.  If you want
a specific version of Perl, say, perl5.005_57, you should place
that directly in the #! line's path.</p>
<p>If the #! line does not contain the word ``perl'', the program named after
the #! is executed instead of the Perl interpreter.  This is slightly
bizarre, but it helps people on machines that don't do #!, because they
can tell a program that their SHELL is <em>/usr/bin/perl</em>, and Perl will then
dispatch the program to the correct interpreter for them.</p>
<p>After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire program to an
internal form.  If there are any compilation errors, execution of the
program is not attempted.  (This is unlike the typical shell script,
which might run part-way through before finding a syntax error.)</p>
<p>If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed.  If the program
runs off the end without hitting an <code>exit()</code> or <code>die()</code> operator, an implicit
<code>exit(0)</code> is provided to indicate successful completion.</p>

<dd>
<p>The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState installer for Perl,
will modify the Registry to associate the <em>.pl</em> extension with the perl
interpreter.  If you install Perl by other means (including building from
the sources), you may have to modify the Registry yourself.  Note that
this means you can no longer tell the difference between an executable
Perl program and a Perl library file.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_macintosh">Macintosh</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Under ``Classic'' MacOS, a perl program will have the appropriate Creator and
Type, so that double-clicking them will invoke the MacPerl application.
Under Mac OS X, clickable apps can be made from any <code>#!</code> script using Wil
Sanchez' DropScript utility: <a href="http://www.wsanchez.net/software/">http://www.wsanchez.net/software/</a> .</p>
</dd>

    $ perl -mysw 'f$env(&quot;procedure&quot;)' 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8' !
    $ exit++ + ++$status != 0 and $exit = $status = undef;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>at the top of your program, where <strong>-mysw</strong> are any command line switches you
want to pass to Perl.  You can now invoke the program directly, by saying
<code>perl program</code>, or as a DCL procedure, by saying <code>@program</code> (or implicitly
via <em>DCL$PATH</em> by just using the name of the program).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This incantation is a bit much to remember, but Perl will display it for
you if you say <code>perl &quot;-V:startperl&quot;</code>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather different ideas
on quoting than Unix shells.  You'll need to learn the special
characters in your command-interpreter (<code>*</code>, <code>\</code> and <code>&quot;</code> are
common) and how to protect whitespace and these characters to run
one-liners (see <strong>-e</strong> below).</p>
<p>On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double ones,
which you must <em>not</em> do on Unix or Plan 9 systems.  You might also
have to change a single % to a %%.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
    # Unix
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'</pre>
<pre>
    # MS-DOS, etc.
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;</pre>
<pre>
    # Macintosh
    print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;
     (then Run &quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)</pre>
<pre>
    # VMS
    perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;</pre>
<p>The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends on the
command and it is entirely possible neither works.  If <strong>4DOS</strong> were
the command shell, this would probably work better:</p>
<pre>
    perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;</pre>
<p><strong>CMD.EXE</strong> in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix functionality in
when nobody was looking, but just try to find documentation for its
quoting rules.</p>
<p>Under the Macintosh, it depends which environment you are using.  The MacPerl
shell, or MPW, is much like Unix shells in its support for several
quoting variants, except that it makes free use of the Macintosh's non-ASCII
characters as control characters.</p>
<p>There is no general solution to all of this.  It's just a mess.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="location_of_perl_x_perl__location_of_interpreter_">Location of Perl
</a></h2>
<p>It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when users can
easily find it.  When possible, it's good for both <em>/usr/bin/perl</em>
and <em>/usr/local/bin/perl</em> to be symlinks to the actual binary.  If
that can't be done, system administrators are strongly encouraged
to put (symlinks to) perl and its accompanying utilities into a
directory typically found along a user's PATH, or in some other
obvious and convenient place.</p>
<p>In this documentation, <code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code> on the first line of the program
will stand in for whatever method works on your system.  You are
advised to use a specific path if you care about a specific version.</p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.00554</pre>
<p>or if you just want to be running at least version, place a statement
like this at the top of your program:</p>
<pre>
    use 5.005_54;</pre>

hexadecimal number.  If there are no digits, the null character is the
separator.  Other switches may precede or follow the digits.  For
example, if you have a version of <strong>find</strong> which can print filenames
terminated by the null character, you can say this:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink</pre>

<p>The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode.

<p>If you want to specify any Unicode character, use the hexadecimal

<li>
<p>In some platforms the C preprocessor knows too much: it knows about
the C++ -style until-end-of-line comments starting with <code>&quot;//&quot;</code>.
This will cause problems with common Perl constructs like</p>
<pre>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>On some platforms, this also makes Perl append suffixes to the

the ``.bat'' and ``.cmd'' suffixes are appended if a lookup for the

<p>This example works on many platforms that have a shell compatible with

<p>The system ignores the first line and feeds the program to <em>/bin/sh</em>,
which proceeds to try to execute the Perl program as a shell script.
The shell executes the second line as a normal shell command, and thus
starts up the Perl interpreter.  On some systems $0 doesn't always
contain the full pathname, so the <strong>-S</strong> tells Perl to search for the
program if necessary.  After Perl locates the program, it parses the
lines and ignores them because the variable $running_under_some_shell
is never true.  If the program will be interpreted by csh, you will need
to replace <code>${1+&quot;$@&quot;}</code> with <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item___"><code>$*</code></a>, even though that doesn't understand
embedded spaces (and such) in the argument list.  To start up sh rather
than csh, some systems may have to replace the #! line with a line
containing just a colon, which will be politely ignored by Perl.  Other
systems can't control that, and need a totally devious construct that
will work under any of <strong>csh</strong>, <strong>sh</strong>, or Perl, such as the following:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
        eval '(exit $?0)' &amp;&amp; eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'

</dd>
<dd>
<p>If the filename supplied contains directory separators (i.e., is an
absolute or relative pathname), and if that file is not found,
platforms that append file extensions will do so and try to look
for the file with those extensions added, one by one.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>On DOS-like platforms, if the program does not contain directory
separators, it will first be searched for in the current directory

</li>
</dl>
<p>On all platforms the default set of layers should give acceptable results.</p>
<p>For UNIX platforms that will equivalent of ``unix perlio'' or ``stdio''.
Configure is setup to prefer ``stdio'' implementation if system's library
provides for fast access to the buffer, otherwise it uses the ``unix perlio''
implementation.</p>
<p>On Win32 the default in this release is ``unix crlf''. Win32's ``stdio''
has a number of bugs/mis-features for perl IO which are somewhat
C compiler vendor/version dependent. Using our own <code>crlf</code> layer as
the buffer avoids those issues and makes things more uniform.
The <code>crlf</code> layer provides CRLF to/from ``\n'' conversion as well as
buffering.</p>
<p>This release uses <code>unix</code> as the bottom layer on Win32 and so still uses C
compiler's numeric file descriptor routines. There is an experimental native
<code>win32</code> layer which is expected to be enhanced and should eventually be
the default under Win32.</p>

<p>Note that Perl doesn't use COMSPEC for this purpose because
COMSPEC has a high degree of variability among users, leading to

Perl normally searches for an IFS-compatible LSP because this is required
for its emulation of Windows sockets as real filehandles.  However, this may
cause problems if you have a firewall such as McAfee Guardian which requires
all applications to use its LSP which is not IFS-compatible, because clearly
Perl will normally avoid using such an LSP.
Setting this environment variable to 1 means that Perl will simply use the
first suitable LSP enumerated in the catalog, which keeps McAfee Guardian
happy (and in that particular case Perl still works too because McAfee
Guardian's LSP actually plays some other games which allow applications
requiring IFS compatibility to work).</p>
