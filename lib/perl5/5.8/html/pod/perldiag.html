<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</p>
<pre>
    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (optional).
    (S) A severe warning (default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</pre>
<p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.</p>
<p>If a message can be controlled by the <code>warnings</code> pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.</p>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <strong>-w</strong>
and <strong>-W</strong> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code>
to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html">the perlvar manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Default warnings are always enabled unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <strong>-X</strong> switch.</p>
<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/eval.html">eval in the perlfunc manpage</a>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.
See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./lib/warnings.html">the warnings manpage</a>.</p>
<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_accept"><code>accept()</code> on closed socket %s</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your <code>socket()</code> call?  See
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/accept.html">accept in the perlfunc manpage</a>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_allocation_too_large_3a__25lx">Allocation too large: %lx</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__27_21_27_allowed_only_after_types__25s">'!' allowed only after types %s</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The '!' is allowed in <code>pack()</code> or <code>unpack()</code> only after certain types.
See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/pack.html">pack in the perlfunc manpage</a>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_s">Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <code>use subs</code> pragma).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code>CORE::</code> prefix
on the operator (e.g. <code>CORE::log($x)</code>) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlsub.html#subroutine_attributes">Subroutine Attributes in the perlsub manpage</a> or
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./lib/attributes.html">the attributes manpage</a>).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_ambiguous_range_in_transliteration_operator">Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) You wrote something like <code>tr/a-z-0//</code> which doesn't mean anything at
all.  To include a <code>-</code> character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last.  (In the past, <code>tr/a-z-0//</code> was synonymous with
<code>tr/a-y//</code>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_ambiguous_use_of__25s_resolved_as__25s">Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W ambiguous)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__27_7c_27_and__27_3c_27_may_not_both_be_specified_">'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to
redirect STDIN using '&lt;'.  Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__27_7c_27_and__27_3e_27_may_not_both_be_specified_">'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and
into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other,
though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script
which 'splits' output into two streams, such as</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_scalar">Applying %s to %s will act on <code>scalar(%s)</code></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W misc) The pattern match (<code>//</code>), substitution (<code>s///</code>), and
transliteration (<code>tr///</code>) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value -- the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash -- and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/grep.html">grep in the perlfunc manpage</a> and <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/map.html">map in the perlfunc manpage</a> for
alternatives.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_args_must_match__23_21_line">Args must match #! line</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The setuid emulator requires that the arguments Perl was invoked
with match the arguments specified on the #! line.  Since some systems
impose a one-argument limit on the #! line, try combining switches;
for example, turn <code>-w -U</code> into <code>-wU</code>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_arg_too_short_for_msgsnd">Arg too short for msgsnd</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) <code>msgsnd()</code> requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__s">%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The argument to <code>exists()</code> must be a hash or array element, such as:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The argument to <code>delete()</code> must be either a hash or array element,
such as:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>or a hash or array slice, such as:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong>%s argument is not a subroutine name</strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The argument to <code>exists()</code> for <code>exists &amp;sub</code> must be a subroutine
name, and not a subroutine call.  <code>exists &amp;sub()</code> will generate this
error.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_argument__22_25s_22_isn_27t_numeric_25s">Argument ``%s'' isn't numeric%s</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_argument_list_not_closed_for_perlio_layer__22_25s_">Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer ``%s''</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you
forgot the ) that closes the argument list.  (Layers take care of transforming
data between external and internal representations.)  Perl stopped parsing
the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer.
If your program didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be
the result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</strong>

<dd>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_assertion_botched_3a__25s">assertion botched: %s</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_assertion_failed_3a_file__22_25s_22">Assertion failed: file ``%s''</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_assignment_to_both_a_list_and_a_scalar">Assignment to both a list and a scalar</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_a_thread_exited_while__25d_threads_were_running">A thread exited while %d threads were running</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily the main
thread) exited while there were still other threads running.
Usually it's a good idea to first collect the return values of the
created threads by joining them, and only then exit from the main
thread.  See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./ext/threads/threads.html">the threads manpage</a>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_access_disallowed_key__27_25s_27_in_a_r">Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in
the current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_bless_into_a_reference">Attempt to bless into a reference</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the <code>bless()</code> operator is expected to be
the name of the package to bless the resulting object into. You've
supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    bless $self, $proto;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>when you intended</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you actually want to bless into the stringified version
of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for
example by:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    bless $self, &quot;$proto&quot;;</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_delete_disallowed_key__27_25s_27_from_a">Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key
which is not in its key set.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_delete_readonly_key__27_25s_27_from_a_r">Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been
declared readonly from a restricted hash.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_free_non_2darena_sv_3a_0x_25lx">Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%lx</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(P internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_free_nonexistent_shared_string">Attempt to free nonexistent shared string</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(P internal) Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count
of a string that can no longer be found in the table.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_free_temp_prematurely">Attempt to free temp prematurely</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
<code>free_tmps()</code> routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
SV before the <code>free_tmps()</code> routine gets a chance, which means that the
<code>free_tmps()</code> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_free_unreferenced_glob_pointers">Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(P internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_free_unreferenced_scalar">Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that <code>SvREFCNT_dec()</code> was called too many times, or
that <code>SvREFCNT_inc()</code> was called too few times, or that the SV was
mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
corrupted.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_join_self">Attempt to join self</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an
impossible task.  You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need
to move the <code>join()</code> to some other thread.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_pack_pointer_to_temporary_value">Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the ``p'' <code>pack()</code> template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the ``p'' <code>pack()</code> template to
avoid this warning.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_set_length_of_freed_array">Attempt to set length of freed array</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed.  You
can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last index
of an array and later assigning through that reference. For example</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    $r = do {my @a; \$#a};
    $$r = 503</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_attempt_to_use_reference_as_lvalue_in_substr">Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item_substr"><code>substr()</code></a>
used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/substr.html">substr in the perlfunc manpage</a>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bad_arg_length_for__25s_2c_is__25d_2c_should_be__2">Bad arg length for %s, is %d, should be %s</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), <code>semctl()</code>
or shmctl().  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
sizeof(struct&nbsp;msqid_ds&nbsp;*), sizeof(struct&nbsp;semid_ds&nbsp;*), and
sizeof(struct&nbsp;shmid_ds&nbsp;*).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bad_evalled_substitution_pattern">Bad evalled substitution pattern</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) You've used the <code>/e</code> switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate,
most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bad_filehandle_3a__25s">Bad filehandle: %s</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the
symbol has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an
open(), or did it in another package.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_free">Bad <code>free()</code> ignored</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called <a href="#item_free"><code>free()</code></a> on something that had never
been malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable <code>PERL_BADFREE</code> to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with ``hard''
dynamic linking, like <code>AIX</code> and <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlrun.html#item_os_2f2"><code>OS/2</code></a>. It is a bug of <code>Berkeley DB</code>
which is left unnoticed if <code>DB</code> uses <em>forgiving</em> system malloc().</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bad_hash">Bad hash</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bad_index_while_coercing_array_into_hash">Bad index while coercing array into hash</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) The index looked up in the hash found as the 0'th element of a
pseudo-hash is not legal.  Index values must be at 1 or greater.
See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlref.html">the perlref manpage</a>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_placed">Badly placed ()'s</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bad_name_after__25s_3a_3a">Bad name after %s::</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
didn't finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside
of quotes, so</p>

    $sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_realloc">Bad <code>realloc()</code> ignored</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called <a href="#item_realloc"><code>realloc()</code></a> on something that had
never been malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled
by setting environment variable <code>PERL_BADFREE</code> to 1.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bad_symbol_for_array">Bad symbol for array</a></strong>

</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bareword_found_in_conditional">Bareword found in conditional</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    open FOO || die;</pre>

<p>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:</p>

</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bareword__22_25s_22_not_allowed_while__22strict_su">Bareword ``%s'' not allowed while ``strict subs'' in use</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) With ``strict subs'' in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the ``=&gt;''
symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bareword__22_25s_22_refers_to_nonexistent_package">Bareword ``%s'' refers to nonexistent package</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form <code>Foo::</code>, but the
compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.  Perhaps
you need to predeclare a package?</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_begin_failed_2d_2dcompilation_aborted">BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_begin_not_safe_after_errors_2d_2dcompilation_abort">BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(F) Perl found a <code>BEGIN {}</code> subroutine (or a <code>use</code> directive, which
implies a <code>BEGIN {}</code>) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the <code>BEGIN {}</code> could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__5c1_better_written_as__241">\1 better written as $1</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.</p>
</dd>

<dd>

<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL <a href="#item_stat"><code>stat()</code></a> routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access checking
routine knows about the Perl <a href="#item_stat"><code>stat</code></a> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>

resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables in
config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as if it
were csh (e.g.  <code>full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'</code>); otherwise, make them all
empty (except that <code>d_csh</code> should be <code>'undef'</code>) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<code>./Configure -S</code> and rebuild Perl.</p>

would probably have caught this error earlier it naturally does not
remedy the fact that your operating system still does not support that

        perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
        perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
                LC_ALL = &quot;En_US&quot;,
                LANG = (unset)

</dd>
<dd>
<p>Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies.  In the above the
settings were that the LC_ALL was ``En_US'' and the LANG had no value.
This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your operating
system supplier and/or system administrator have set up the so-called
locale system but Perl could not use those settings.  This was not
dead serious, fortunately: there is a ``default locale'' called ``C'' that
Perl can and will use, the script will be run.  Before you really fix
the problem, however, you will get the same error message each time
you run Perl.  How to really fix the problem can be found in

<dt><strong>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</strong>

<dd>
<p>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code>AUTOLOAD</code> subroutines
are looked up as methods (using the <code>@ISA</code> hierarchy) even when the
subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
<code>Foo::bar()</code>), not as methods (e.g. <code>Foo-&gt;bar()</code> or <code>&lt;
$obj-</code><code>bar()</code> &gt;&gt;).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' <code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <code>AUTOLOAD</code> for non-methods from a base class
named <code>BaseClass</code>, execute <code>*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</code> during
startup.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In code that currently says <a href="#item_qw"><code>use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);</code></a>

<p>If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your reference, like so:

explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of

<p>To help you figure out what was undefined, perl tells you what operation
you used the undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your
program and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily
appear literally in your program.  For example, <code>&quot;that $foo&quot;</code> is
usually optimized into <code>&quot;that &quot; . $foo</code>, and the warning will refer to
the <code>concatenation (.)</code> operator, even though there is no <code>.</code> in your

0xDFFF (inclusive).  That range is reserved exclusively for the use of
UTF-16 encoding (by having two 16-bit UCS-2 characters); but Perl
encodes its characters in UTF-8, so what you got is a very illegal

<p>(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob),
<code>each()</code>, or <code>readdir()</code> as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs

<dd>
<p>(F) While ``use strict'' in effect, you referred to a global variable that

<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
