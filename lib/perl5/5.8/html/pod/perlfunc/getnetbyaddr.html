<p>These routines perform the same functions as their counterparts in the
system library.  In list context, the return values from the
various get routines are as follows:</p>
<pre>
    ($name,$passwd,$uid,$gid,
       $quota,$comment,$gcos,$dir,$shell,$expire) = getpw*
    ($name,$passwd,$gid,$members) = getgr*
    ($name,$aliases,$addrtype,$length,@addrs) = gethost*
    ($name,$aliases,$addrtype,$net) = getnet*
    ($name,$aliases,$proto) = getproto*
    ($name,$aliases,$port,$proto) = getserv*</pre>
<p>(If the entry doesn't exist you get a null list.)</p>
<p>The exact meaning of the $gcos field varies but it usually contains
the real name of the user (as opposed to the login name) and other
information pertaining to the user.  Beware, however, that in many
system users are able to change this information and therefore it
cannot be trusted and therefore the $gcos is tainted (see
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlsec.html">the perlsec manpage</a>).  The $passwd and $shell, user's encrypted password and
login shell, are also tainted, because of the same reason.</p>
<p>In scalar context, you get the name, unless the function was a
lookup by name, in which case you get the other thing, whatever it is.
(If the entry doesn't exist you get the undefined value.)  For example:</p>
<pre>
    $uid   = getpwnam($name);
    $name  = getpwuid($num);
    $name  = getpwent();
    $gid   = getgrnam($name);
    $name  = getgrgid($num);
    $name  = getgrent();
    #etc.</pre>
<p>In <em>getpw*()</em> the fields $quota, $comment, and $expire are special
cases in the sense that in many systems they are unsupported.  If the
$quota is unsupported, it is an empty scalar.  If it is supported, it
usually encodes the disk quota.  If the $comment field is unsupported,
it is an empty scalar.  If it is supported it usually encodes some
administrative comment about the user.  In some systems the $quota
field may be $change or $age, fields that have to do with password
aging.  In some systems the $comment field may be $class.  The $expire
field, if present, encodes the expiration period of the account or the
password.  For the availability and the exact meaning of these fields
in your system, please consult your <code>getpwnam(3)</code> documentation and your
<em>pwd.h</em> file.  You can also find out from within Perl what your
$quota and $comment fields mean and whether you have the $expire field
by using the <code>Config</code> module and the values <code>d_pwquota</code>, <code>d_pwage</code>,
<code>d_pwchange</code>, <code>d_pwcomment</code>, and <code>d_pwexpire</code>.  Shadow password
files are only supported if your vendor has implemented them in the
intuitive fashion that calling the regular C library routines gets the
shadow versions if you're running under privilege or if there exists
the <code>shadow(3)</code> functions as found in System V (this includes Solaris
and Linux.)  Those systems that implement a proprietary shadow password
facility are unlikely to be supported.</p>
<p>The $members value returned by <em>getgr*()</em> is a space separated list of
the login names of the members of the group.</p>
<p>For the <em>gethost*()</em> functions, if the <code>h_errno</code> variable is supported in
C, it will be returned to you via <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item__"><code>$?</code></a> if the function call fails.  The
<code>@addrs</code> value returned by a successful call is a list of the raw
addresses returned by the corresponding system library call.  In the
Internet domain, each address is four bytes long and you can unpack it
by saying something like:</p>
<pre>
    ($a,$b,$c,$d) = unpack('C4',$addr[0]);</pre>
<p>The Socket library makes this slightly easier:</p>
<pre>
    use Socket;
    $iaddr = inet_aton(&quot;127.1&quot;); # or whatever address
    $name  = gethostbyaddr($iaddr, AF_INET);</pre>
<pre>
    # or going the other way
    $straddr = inet_ntoa($iaddr);</pre>
<p>If you get tired of remembering which element of the return list
contains which return value, by-name interfaces are provided
in standard modules: <code>File::stat</code>, <code>Net::hostent</code>, <code>Net::netent</code>,
<code>Net::protoent</code>, <code>Net::servent</code>, <code>Time::gmtime</code>, <code>Time::localtime</code>,
and <code>User::grent</code>.  These override the normal built-ins, supplying
versions that return objects with the appropriate names
for each field.  For example:</p>
<pre>
   use File::stat;
   use User::pwent;
   $is_his = (stat($filename)-&gt;uid == pwent($whoever)-&gt;uid);</pre>
<p>Even though it looks like they're the same method calls (uid),
they aren't, because a <code>File::stat</code> object is different from
a <code>User::pwent</code> object.</p>
