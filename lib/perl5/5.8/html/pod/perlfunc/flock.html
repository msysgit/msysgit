<p>Calls flock(2), or an emulation of it, on FILEHANDLE.  Returns true
for success, false on failure.  Produces a fatal error if used on a
machine that doesn't implement flock(2), <code>fcntl(2)</code> locking, or lockf(3).
<code>flock</code> is Perl's portable file locking interface, although it locks
only entire files, not records.</p>
<p>Two potentially non-obvious but traditional <code>flock</code> semantics are
that it waits indefinitely until the lock is granted, and that its locks
<strong>merely advisory</strong>.  Such discretionary locks are more flexible, but offer
fewer guarantees.  This means that programs that do not also use <code>flock</code>
may modify files locked with <code>flock</code>.  See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlport.html">the perlport manpage</a>, 
your port's specific documentation, or your system-specific local manpages
for details.  It's best to assume traditional behavior if you're writing
portable programs.  (But if you're not, you should as always feel perfectly
free to write for your own system's idiosyncrasies (sometimes called
``features'').  Slavish adherence to portability concerns shouldn't get
in the way of your getting your job done.)</p>
<p>OPERATION is one of LOCK_SH, LOCK_EX, or LOCK_UN, possibly combined with
LOCK_NB.  These constants are traditionally valued 1, 2, 8 and 4, but
you can use the symbolic names if you import them from the Fcntl module,
either individually, or as a group using the ':flock' tag.  LOCK_SH
requests a shared lock, LOCK_EX requests an exclusive lock, and LOCK_UN
releases a previously requested lock.  If LOCK_NB is bitwise-or'ed with
LOCK_SH or LOCK_EX then <code>flock</code> will return immediately rather than blocking
waiting for the lock (check the return status to see if you got it).</p>
<p>To avoid the possibility of miscoordination, Perl now flushes FILEHANDLE
before locking or unlocking it.</p>
<p>Note that the emulation built with <code>lockf(3)</code> doesn't provide shared
locks, and it requires that FILEHANDLE be open with write intent.  These
are the semantics that <code>lockf(3)</code> implements.  Most if not all systems
implement <code>lockf(3)</code> in terms of <code>fcntl(2)</code> locking, though, so the
differing semantics shouldn't bite too many people.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>fcntl(2)</code> emulation of <code>flock(3)</code> requires that FILEHANDLE
be open with read intent to use LOCK_SH and requires that it be open
with write intent to use LOCK_EX.</p>
<p>Note also that some versions of <code>flock</code> cannot lock things over the
network; you would need to use the more system-specific <code>fcntl</code> for
that.  If you like you can force Perl to ignore your system's <code>flock(2)</code>
function, and so provide its own fcntl(2)-based emulation, by passing
the switch <code>-Ud_flock</code> to the <em>Configure</em> program when you configure
perl.</p>
<p>Here's a mailbox appender for BSD systems.</p>
<pre>
    use Fcntl ':flock'; # import LOCK_* constants</pre>
<pre>
    sub lock {
        flock(MBOX,LOCK_EX);
        # and, in case someone appended
        # while we were waiting...
        seek(MBOX, 0, 2);
    }</pre>
<pre>
    sub unlock {
        flock(MBOX,LOCK_UN);
    }</pre>
<pre>
    open(MBOX, &quot;&gt;&gt;/usr/spool/mail/$ENV{'USER'}&quot;)
            or die &quot;Can't open mailbox: $!&quot;;</pre>
<pre>
    lock();
    print MBOX $msg,&quot;\n\n&quot;;
    unlock();</pre>
<p>On systems that support a real flock(), locks are inherited across <code>fork()</code>
calls, whereas those that must resort to the more capricious <code>fcntl()</code>
function lose the locks, making it harder to write servers.</p>
<p>See also <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./ext/DB_File/DB_File.html">the DB_File manpage</a> for other <code>flock()</code> examples.</p>
