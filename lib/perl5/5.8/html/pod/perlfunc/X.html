<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>A file test, where X is one of the letters listed below.  This unary
operator takes one argument, either a filename or a filehandle, and
tests the associated file to see if something is true about it.  If the
argument is omitted, tests <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item___"><code>$_</code></a>, except for <code>-t</code>, which tests STDIN.
Unless otherwise documented, it returns <code>1</code> for true and <code>''</code> for false, or
the undefined value if the file doesn't exist.  Despite the funny
names, precedence is the same as any other named unary operator, and
the argument may be parenthesized like any other unary operator.  The
operator may be any of:</p>
<pre>
    -r  File is readable by effective uid/gid.
    -w  File is writable by effective uid/gid.
    -x  File is executable by effective uid/gid.
    -o  File is owned by effective uid.</pre>
<pre>
    -R  File is readable by real uid/gid.
    -W  File is writable by real uid/gid.
    -X  File is executable by real uid/gid.
    -O  File is owned by real uid.</pre>
<pre>
    -e  File exists.
    -z  File has zero size (is empty).
    -s  File has nonzero size (returns size in bytes).</pre>
<pre>
    -f  File is a plain file.
    -d  File is a directory.
    -l  File is a symbolic link.
    -p  File is a named pipe (FIFO), or Filehandle is a pipe.
    -S  File is a socket.
    -b  File is a block special file.
    -c  File is a character special file.
    -t  Filehandle is opened to a tty.</pre>
<pre>
    -u  File has setuid bit set.
    -g  File has setgid bit set.
    -k  File has sticky bit set.</pre>
<pre>
    -T  File is an ASCII text file (heuristic guess).
    -B  File is a &quot;binary&quot; file (opposite of -T).</pre>
<pre>
    -M  Script start time minus file modification time, in days.
    -A  Same for access time.
    -C  Same for inode change time (Unix, may differ for other platforms)</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        chomp;
        next unless -f $_;      # ignore specials
        #...
    }</pre>
<p>The interpretation of the file permission operators <code>-r</code>, <code>-R</code>,
<code>-w</code>, <code>-W</code>, <code>-x</code>, and <code>-X</code> is by default based solely on the mode
of the file and the uids and gids of the user.  There may be other
reasons you can't actually read, write, or execute the file.  Such
reasons may be for example network filesystem access controls, ACLs
(access control lists), read-only filesystems, and unrecognized
executable formats.</p>
<p>Also note that, for the superuser on the local filesystems, the <code>-r</code>,
<code>-R</code>, <code>-w</code>, and <code>-W</code> tests always return 1, and <code>-x</code> and <code>-X</code> return 1
if any execute bit is set in the mode.  Scripts run by the superuser
may thus need to do a <code>stat()</code> to determine the actual mode of the file,
or temporarily set their effective uid to something else.</p>
<p>If you are using ACLs, there is a pragma called <code>filetest</code> that may
produce more accurate results than the bare <code>stat()</code> mode bits.
When under the <code>use filetest 'access'</code> the above-mentioned filetests
will test whether the permission can (not) be granted using the
<code>access()</code> family of system calls.  Also note that the <code>-x</code> and <code>-X</code> may
under this pragma return true even if there are no execute permission
bits set (nor any extra execute permission ACLs).  This strangeness is
due to the underlying system calls' definitions.  Read the
documentation for the <code>filetest</code> pragma for more information.</p>
<p>Note that <code>-s/a/b/</code> does not do a negated substitution.  Saying
<code>-exp($foo)</code> still works as expected, however--only single letters
following a minus are interpreted as file tests.</p>
<p>The <code>-T</code> and <code>-B</code> switches work as follows.  The first block or so of the
file is examined for odd characters such as strange control codes or
characters with the high bit set.  If too many strange characters (&gt;30%)
are found, it's a <code>-B</code> file; otherwise it's a <code>-T</code> file.  Also, any file
containing null in the first block is considered a binary file.  If <code>-T</code>
or <code>-B</code> is used on a filehandle, the current IO buffer is examined
rather than the first block.  Both <code>-T</code> and <code>-B</code> return true on a null
file, or a file at EOF when testing a filehandle.  Because you have to
read a file to do the <code>-T</code> test, on most occasions you want to use a <code>-f</code>
against the file first, as in <code>next unless -f $file &amp;&amp; -T $file</code>.</p>
<p>If any of the file tests (or either the <code>stat</code> or <code>lstat</code> operators) are given
the special filehandle consisting of a solitary underline, then the stat
structure of the previous file test (or stat operator) is used, saving
a system call.  (This doesn't work with <code>-t</code>, and you need to remember
that <code>lstat()</code> and <code>-l</code> will leave values in the stat structure for the
symbolic link, not the real file.)  (Also, if the stat buffer was filled by
an <code>lstat</code> call, <code>-T</code> and <code>-B</code> will reset it with the results of <code>stat _</code>).
Example:</p>
<pre>
    print &quot;Can do.\n&quot; if -r $a || -w _ || -x _;</pre>
<pre>
    stat($filename);
    print &quot;Readable\n&quot; if -r _;
    print &quot;Writable\n&quot; if -w _;
    print &quot;Executable\n&quot; if -x _;
    print &quot;Setuid\n&quot; if -u _;
    print &quot;Setgid\n&quot; if -g _;
    print &quot;Sticky\n&quot; if -k _;
    print &quot;Text\n&quot; if -T _;
    print &quot;Binary\n&quot; if -B _;</pre>
