<p>Demands a version of Perl specified by VERSION, or demands some semantics
specified by EXPR or by <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item___"><code>$_</code></a> if EXPR is not supplied.</p>
<p>VERSION may be either a numeric argument such as 5.006, which will be
compared to <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item___"><code>$]</code></a>, or a literal of the form v5.6.1, which will be compared
to <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item___v"><code>$^V</code></a> (aka $PERL_VERSION).  A fatal error is produced at run time if
VERSION is greater than the version of the current Perl interpreter.
Compare with <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/use.html">use in the perlfunc manpage</a>, which can do a similar check at compile time.</p>
<p>Specifying VERSION as a literal of the form v5.6.1 should generally be
avoided, because it leads to misleading error messages under earlier
versions of Perl that do not support this syntax.  The equivalent numeric
version should be used instead.</p>
<pre>
    require v5.6.1;     # run time version check
    require 5.6.1;      # ditto
    require 5.006_001;  # ditto; preferred for backwards compatibility</pre>
<p>Otherwise, <code>require</code> demands that a library file be included if it
hasn't already been included.  The file is included via the do-FILE
mechanism, which is essentially just a variety of <code>eval</code>.  Has
semantics similar to the following subroutine:</p>
<pre>
    sub require {
       my ($filename) = @_;
       if (exists $INC{$filename}) {
           return 1 if $INC{$filename};
           die &quot;Compilation failed in require&quot;;
       }
       my ($realfilename,$result);
       ITER: {
           foreach $prefix (@INC) {
               $realfilename = &quot;$prefix/$filename&quot;;
               if (-f $realfilename) {
                   $INC{$filename} = $realfilename;
                   $result = do $realfilename;
                   last ITER;
               }
           }
           die &quot;Can't find $filename in \@INC&quot;;
       }
       if ($@) {
           $INC{$filename} = undef;
           die $@;
       } elsif (!$result) {
           delete $INC{$filename};
           die &quot;$filename did not return true value&quot;;
       } else {
           return $result;
       }
    }</pre>
<p>Note that the file will not be included twice under the same specified
name.</p>
<p>The file must return true as the last statement to indicate
successful execution of any initialization code, so it's customary to
end such a file with <code>1;</code> unless you're sure it'll return true
otherwise.  But it's better just to put the <code>1;</code>, in case you add more
statements.</p>
<p>If EXPR is a bareword, the require assumes a ``<em>.pm</em>'' extension and
replaces ``<em>::</em>'' with ``<em>/</em>'' in the filename for you,
to make it easy to load standard modules.  This form of loading of
modules does not risk altering your namespace.</p>
<p>In other words, if you try this:</p>
<pre>
        require Foo::Bar;    # a splendid bareword</pre>
<p>The require function will actually look for the ``<em>Foo/Bar.pm</em>'' file in the
directories specified in the <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item__inc"><code>@INC</code></a> array.</p>
<p>But if you try this:</p>
<pre>
        $class = 'Foo::Bar';
        require $class;      # $class is not a bareword
    #or
        require &quot;Foo::Bar&quot;;  # not a bareword because of the &quot;&quot;</pre>
<p>The require function will look for the ``<em>Foo::Bar</em>'' file in the @INC array and
will complain about not finding ``<em>Foo::Bar</em>'' there.  In this case you can do:</p>
<pre>
        eval &quot;require $class&quot;;</pre>
<p>Now that you understand how <code>require</code> looks for files in the case of
a bareword argument, there is a little extra functionality going on
behind the scenes.  Before <code>require</code> looks for a ``<em>.pm</em>'' extension,
it will first look for a filename with a ``<em>.pmc</em>'' extension.  A file
with this extension is assumed to be Perl bytecode generated by
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./ext/B/B/Bytecode.html">B::Bytecode</a>.  If this file is found, and its modification
time is newer than a coinciding ``<em>.pm</em>'' non-compiled file, it will be
loaded in place of that non-compiled file ending in a ``<em>.pm</em>'' extension.</p>
<p>You can also insert hooks into the import facility, by putting directly
Perl code into the @INC array.  There are three forms of hooks: subroutine
references, array references and blessed objects.</p>
<p>Subroutine references are the simplest case.  When the inclusion system
walks through @INC and encounters a subroutine, this subroutine gets
called with two parameters, the first being a reference to itself, and the
second the name of the file to be included (e.g. ``<em>Foo/Bar.pm</em>'').  The
subroutine should return <code>undef</code> or a filehandle, from which the file to
include will be read.  If <code>undef</code> is returned, <code>require</code> will look at
the remaining elements of @INC.</p>
<p>If the hook is an array reference, its first element must be a subroutine
reference.  This subroutine is called as above, but the first parameter is
the array reference.  This enables to pass indirectly some arguments to
the subroutine.</p>
<p>In other words, you can write:</p>
<pre>
    push @INC, \&amp;my_sub;
    sub my_sub {
        my ($coderef, $filename) = @_;  # $coderef is \&amp;my_sub
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre>
    push @INC, [ \&amp;my_sub, $x, $y, ... ];
    sub my_sub {
        my ($arrayref, $filename) = @_;
        # Retrieve $x, $y, ...
        my @parameters = @$arrayref[1..$#$arrayref];
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>If the hook is an object, it must provide an INC method that will be
called as above, the first parameter being the object itself.  (Note that
you must fully qualify the sub's name, as it is always forced into package
<code>main</code>.)  Here is a typical code layout:</p>
<pre>
    # In Foo.pm
    package Foo;
    sub new { ... }
    sub Foo::INC {
        my ($self, $filename) = @_;
        ...
    }</pre>
<pre>
    # In the main program
    push @INC, new Foo(...);</pre>
<p>Note that these hooks are also permitted to set the %INC entry
corresponding to the files they have loaded. See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#_inc">%INC in the perlvar manpage</a>.</p>
<p>For a yet-more-powerful import facility, see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/use.html">use in the perlfunc manpage</a> and <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlmod.html">the perlmod manpage</a>.</p>
