<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>The <code>goto-LABEL</code> form finds the statement labeled with LABEL and resumes
execution there.  It may not be used to go into any construct that
requires initialization, such as a subroutine or a <code>foreach</code> loop.  It
also can't be used to go into a construct that is optimized away,
or to get out of a block or subroutine given to <code>sort</code>.
It can be used to go almost anywhere else within the dynamic scope,
including out of subroutines, but it's usually better to use some other
construct such as <code>last</code> or <code>die</code>.  The author of Perl has never felt the
need to use this form of <code>goto</code> (in Perl, that is--C is another matter).
(The difference being that C does not offer named loops combined with
loop control.  Perl does, and this replaces most structured uses of <code>goto</code>
in other languages.)</p>
<p>The <code>goto-EXPR</code> form expects a label name, whose scope will be resolved
dynamically.  This allows for computed <code>goto</code>s per FORTRAN, but isn't
necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:</p>
<pre>
    goto (&quot;FOO&quot;, &quot;BAR&quot;, &quot;GLARCH&quot;)[$i];</pre>
<p>The <code>goto-&amp;NAME</code> form is quite different from the other forms of
<code>goto</code>.  In fact, it isn't a goto in the normal sense at all, and
doesn't have the stigma associated with other gotos.  Instead, it
exits the current subroutine (losing any changes set by <code>local())</code> and
immediately calls in its place the named subroutine using the current
value of @_.  This is used by <code>AUTOLOAD</code> subroutines that wish to
load another subroutine and then pretend that the other subroutine had
been called in the first place (except that any modifications to <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item___"><code>@_</code></a>
in the current subroutine are propagated to the other subroutine.)
After the <code>goto</code>, not even <code>caller</code> will be able to tell that this
routine was called first.</p>
<p>NAME needn't be the name of a subroutine; it can be a scalar variable
containing a code reference, or a block that evaluates to a code
reference.</p>
