<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>perlfaq8 - System Interaction ($Revision: 1.27 $, $Date: 2005/12/31 00:54:37 $)</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This section of the Perl FAQ covers questions involving operating
system interaction.  Topics include interprocess communication (IPC),
control over the user-interface (keyboard, screen and pointing
devices), and most anything else not related to data manipulation.</p>
<p>Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your
operating system (eg, <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvms.html">the perlvms manpage</a>, <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlplan9.html">the perlplan9 manpage</a>, ...).  These should
contain more detailed information on the vagaries of your perl.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_find_out_which_operating_system_i_m_running_under">How do I find out which operating system I'm running under?</a></h2>
<p>The $^O variable ($OSNAME if you use English) contains an indication of
the name of the operating system (not its release number) that your perl
binary was built for.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_come_exec___doesn_t_return">How come <code>exec()</code> doesn't return?</a></h2>
<p>Because that's what it does: it replaces your currently running
program with a different one.  If you want to keep going (as is
probably the case if you're asking this question) use <code>system()</code>
instead.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_do_fancy_stuff_with_the_keyboard_screen_mouse">How do I do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse?</a></h2>
<p>How you access/control keyboards, screens, and pointing devices
(``mice'') is system-dependent.  Try the following modules:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_keyboard">Keyboard</a></strong>

<dd>
<pre>
        Term::Cap               Standard perl distribution
        Term::ReadKey           CPAN
        Term::ReadLine::Gnu     CPAN
        Term::ReadLine::Perl    CPAN
        Term::Screen            CPAN</pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="item_screen">Screen</a></strong>

<dd>
<pre>
        Term::Cap               Standard perl distribution
        Curses                  CPAN
        Term::ANSIColor         CPAN</pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="item_mouse">Mouse</a></strong>

<dd>
<pre>
        Tk                      CPAN</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some of these specific cases are shown as examples in other answers
in this section of the perlfaq.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_print_something_out_in_color">How do I print something out in color?</a></h2>
<p>In general, you don't, because you don't know whether
the recipient has a color-aware display device.  If you
know that they have an ANSI terminal that understands
color, you can use the Term::ANSIColor module from CPAN:</p>
<pre>
    use Term::ANSIColor;
    print color(&quot;red&quot;), &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);
    print color(&quot;green&quot;), &quot;Go!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);</pre>
<p>Or like this:</p>
<pre>
    use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants);
    print RED, &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, RESET;
    print GREEN, &quot;Go!\n&quot;, RESET;</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_read_just_one_key_without_waiting_for_a_return_key">How do I read just one key without waiting for a return key?</a></h2>
<p>Controlling input buffering is a remarkably system-dependent matter.
On many systems, you can just use the <strong>stty</strong> command as shown in
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/getc.html">getc in the perlfunc manpage</a>, but as you see, that's already getting you into
portability snags.</p>
<pre>
    open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;) or die &quot;no tty: $!&quot;;
    system &quot;stty  cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;
    $key = getc(TTY);           # perhaps this works
    # OR ELSE
    sysread(TTY, $key, 1);      # probably this does
    system &quot;stty -cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;</pre>
<p>The Term::ReadKey module from CPAN offers an easy-to-use interface that
should be more efficient than shelling out to <strong>stty</strong> for each key.
It even includes limited support for Windows.</p>
<pre>
    use Term::ReadKey;
    ReadMode('cbreak');
    $key = ReadKey(0);
    ReadMode('normal');</pre>
<p>However, using the code requires that you have a working C compiler
and can use it to build and install a CPAN module.  Here's a solution
using the standard POSIX module, which is already on your systems
(assuming your system supports POSIX).</p>
<pre>
    use HotKey;
    $key = readkey();</pre>
<p>And here's the HotKey module, which hides the somewhat mystifying calls
to manipulate the POSIX termios structures.</p>
<pre>
    # HotKey.pm
    package HotKey;</pre>
<pre>
    @ISA = qw(Exporter);
    @EXPORT = qw(cbreak cooked readkey);</pre>
<pre>
    use strict;
    use POSIX qw(:termios_h);
    my ($term, $oterm, $echo, $noecho, $fd_stdin);</pre>
<pre>
    $fd_stdin = fileno(STDIN);
    $term     = POSIX::Termios-&gt;new();
    $term-&gt;getattr($fd_stdin);
    $oterm     = $term-&gt;getlflag();</pre>
<pre>
    $echo     = ECHO | ECHOK | ICANON;
    $noecho   = $oterm &amp; ~$echo;</pre>
<pre>
    sub cbreak {
        $term-&gt;setlflag($noecho);  # ok, so i don't want echo either
        $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 1);
        $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
    }</pre>
<pre>
    sub cooked {
        $term-&gt;setlflag($oterm);
        $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 0);
        $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
    }</pre>
<pre>
    sub readkey {
        my $key = '';
        cbreak();
        sysread(STDIN, $key, 1);
        cooked();
        return $key;
    }</pre>
<pre>
    END { cooked() }</pre>
<pre>
    1;</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_check_whether_input_is_ready_on_the_keyboard">How do I check whether input is ready on the keyboard?</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to read a key in nonblocking mode with the
Term::ReadKey module from CPAN, passing it an argument of -1 to indicate
not to block:</p>
<pre>
    use Term::ReadKey;</pre>
<pre>
    ReadMode('cbreak');</pre>
<pre>
    if (defined ($char = ReadKey(-1)) ) {
        # input was waiting and it was $char
    } else {
        # no input was waiting
    }</pre>
<pre>
    ReadMode('normal');                  # restore normal tty settings</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_clear_the_screen">How do I clear the screen?</a></h2>
<p>If you only have do so infrequently, use <code>system</code>:</p>
<pre>
    system(&quot;clear&quot;);</pre>
<p>If you have to do this a lot, save the clear string
so you can print it 100 times without calling a program
100 times:</p>
<pre>
    $clear_string = `clear`;
    print $clear_string;</pre>
<p>If you're planning on doing other screen manipulations, like cursor
positions, etc, you might wish to use Term::Cap module:</p>
<pre>
    use Term::Cap;
    $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( {OSPEED =&gt; 9600} );
    $clear_string = $terminal-&gt;Tputs('cl');</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_get_the_screen_size">How do I get the screen size?</a></h2>
<p>If you have Term::ReadKey module installed from CPAN,
you can use it to fetch the width and height in characters
and in pixels:</p>
<pre>
    use Term::ReadKey;
    ($wchar, $hchar, $wpixels, $hpixels) = GetTerminalSize();</pre>
<p>This is more portable than the raw <code>ioctl</code>, but not as
illustrative:</p>
<pre>
    require 'sys/ioctl.ph';
    die &quot;no TIOCGWINSZ &quot; unless defined &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;
    open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;)                     or die &quot;No tty: $!&quot;;
    unless (ioctl(TTY, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ, $winsize='')) {
        die sprintf &quot;$0: ioctl TIOCGWINSZ (%08x: $!)\n&quot;, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;
    }
    ($row, $col, $xpixel, $ypixel) = unpack('S4', $winsize);
    print &quot;(row,col) = ($row,$col)&quot;;
    print &quot;  (xpixel,ypixel) = ($xpixel,$ypixel)&quot; if $xpixel || $ypixel;
    print &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_ask_the_user_for_a_password">How do I ask the user for a password?</a></h2>
<p>(This question has nothing to do with the web.  See a different
FAQ for that.)</p>
<p>There's an example of this in <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/crypt.html">crypt in the perlfunc manpage</a>).  First, you put the
terminal into ``no echo'' mode, then just read the password normally.
You may do this with an old-style <code>ioctl()</code> function, POSIX terminal
control (see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./ext/POSIX/POSIX.html">the POSIX manpage</a> or its documentation the Camel Book), or a call
to the <strong>stty</strong> program, with varying degrees of portability.</p>
<p>You can also do this for most systems using the Term::ReadKey module
from CPAN, which is easier to use and in theory more portable.</p>
<pre>
    use Term::ReadKey;</pre>
<pre>
    ReadMode('noecho');
    $password = ReadLine(0);</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_read_and_write_the_serial_port">How do I read and write the serial port?</a></h2>
<p>This depends on which operating system your program is running on.  In
the case of Unix, the serial ports will be accessible through files in
/dev; on other systems, device names will doubtless differ.
Several problem areas common to all device interaction are the
following:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_lockfiles">lockfiles</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Your system may use lockfiles to control multiple access.  Make sure
you follow the correct protocol.  Unpredictable behavior can result
from multiple processes reading from one device.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_open_mode">open mode</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If you expect to use both read and write operations on the device,
you'll have to open it for update (see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/open.html">open in the perlfunc manpage</a> for
details).  You may wish to open it without running the risk of
blocking by using <code>sysopen()</code> and <code>O_RDWR|O_NDELAY|O_NOCTTY</code> from the
Fcntl module (part of the standard perl distribution).  See
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/sysopen.html">sysopen in the perlfunc manpage</a> for more on this approach.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_end_of_line">end of line</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Some devices will be expecting a ``\r'' at the end of each line rather
than a ``\n''.  In some ports of perl, ``\r'' and ``\n'' are different from
their usual (Unix) ASCII values of ``\012'' and ``\015''.  You may have to
give the numeric values you want directly, using octal (``\015''), hex
(``0x0D''), or as a control-character specification (``\cM'').</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    print DEV &quot;atv1\012&quot;;       # wrong, for some devices
    print DEV &quot;atv1\015&quot;;       # right, for some devices</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Even though with normal text files a ``\n'' will do the trick, there is
still no unified scheme for terminating a line that is portable
between Unix, DOS/Win, and Macintosh, except to terminate <em>ALL</em> line
ends with ``\015\012'', and strip what you don't need from the output.
This applies especially to socket I/O and autoflushing, discussed
next.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_flushing_output">flushing output</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If you expect characters to get to your device when you <code>print()</code> them,
you'll want to autoflush that filehandle.  You can use <code>select()</code>
and the <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item___"><code>$|</code></a> variable to control autoflushing (see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#_e_verbar_">$&verbar; in the perlvar manpage</a>
and <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/select.html">select in the perlfunc manpage</a>, or <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfaq5.html">the perlfaq5 manpage</a>, ``How do I flush/unbuffer an
output filehandle?  Why must I do this?''):</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    $oldh = select(DEV);
    $| = 1;
    select($oldh);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You'll also see code that does this without a temporary variable, as in</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    select((select(DEV), $| = 1)[0]);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Or if you don't mind pulling in a few thousand lines
of code just because you're afraid of a little $| variable:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    use IO::Handle;
    DEV-&gt;autoflush(1);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>As mentioned in the previous item, this still doesn't work when using
socket I/O between Unix and Macintosh.  You'll need to hard code your
line terminators, in that case.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_non_2dblocking_input">non-blocking input</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If you are doing a blocking <code>read()</code> or sysread(), you'll have to
arrange for an alarm handler to provide a timeout (see
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/alarm.html">alarm in the perlfunc manpage</a>).  If you have a non-blocking open, you'll likely
have a non-blocking read, which means you may have to use a 4-arg
<code>select()</code> to determine whether I/O is ready on that device (see
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/select.html">select in the perlfunc manpage</a>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>While trying to read from his caller-id box, the notorious Jamie Zawinski
&lt;<a href="mailto:jwz@netscape.com">jwz@netscape.com</a>&gt;, after much gnashing of teeth and fighting with sysread,
sysopen, POSIX's tcgetattr business, and various other functions that
go bump in the night, finally came up with this:</p>
<pre>
    sub open_modem {
        use IPC::Open2;
        my $stty = `/bin/stty -g`;
        open2( \*MODEM_IN, \*MODEM_OUT, &quot;cu -l$modem_device -s2400 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;);

<h2><a name="how_do_i_decode_encrypted_password_files">How do I decode encrypted password files?</a></h2>
<p>You spend lots and lots of money on dedicated hardware, but this is
bound to get you talked about.</p>
<p>Seriously, you can't if they are Unix password files--the Unix
password system employs one-way encryption.  It's more like hashing than
encryption.  The best you can check is whether something else hashes to
the same string.  You can't turn a hash back into the original string.
Programs like Crack
can forcibly (and intelligently) try to guess passwords, but don't
(can't) guarantee quick success.</p>
<p>If you're worried about users selecting bad passwords, you should
proactively check when they try to change their password (by modifying
passwd(1), for example).</p>

<h2><a name="how_do_i_start_a_process_in_the_background">How do I start a process in the background?</a></h2>
<p>Several modules can start other processes that do not block

IPC::Run, and some of the POE modules.  See CPAN for more
details.</p>
<p>You could also use</p>
<pre>
    system(&quot;cmd &amp;&quot;)</pre>
<p>or you could use fork as documented in <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/fork.html">fork in the perlfunc manpage</a>, with
further examples in <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlipc.html">the perlipc manpage</a>.  Some things to be aware of, if you're

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_stdin_2c_stdout_2c_and_stderr_are_shared">STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are shared</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Both the main process and the backgrounded one (the ``child'' process)
share the same STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR filehandles.  If both try to
access them at once, strange things can happen.  You may want to close
or reopen these for the child.  You can get around this with
<code>open</code>ing a pipe (see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/open.html">open in the perlfunc manpage</a>) but on some systems this
means that the child process cannot outlive the parent.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_signals">Signals</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>You'll have to catch the SIGCHLD signal, and possibly SIGPIPE too.
SIGCHLD is sent when the backgrounded process finishes.  SIGPIPE is
sent when you write to a filehandle whose child process has closed (an
untrapped SIGPIPE can cause your program to silently die).  This is
not an issue with <code>system(&quot;cmd&amp;&quot;)</code>.</p>

<h2><a name="how_do_i_trap_control_characters_signals">How do I trap control characters/signals?</a></h2>
<p>You don't actually ``trap'' a control character.  Instead, that character
generates a signal which is sent to your terminal's currently
foregrounded process group, which you then trap in your process.
Signals are documented in <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlipc/signals.html">Signals in the perlipc manpage</a> and the
section on ``Signals'' in the Camel.</p>
<p>You can set the values of the %SIG hash to be the functions you want
to handle the signal.  After perl catches the signal, it looks in %SIG
for a key with the same name as the signal, then calls the subroutine
value for that key.</p>
<pre>
        # as an anonymous subroutine</pre>
<pre>
        $SIG{INT} = sub { syswrite(STDERR, &quot;ouch\n&quot;, 5 ) };</pre>
<pre>
        # or a reference to a function</pre>
<pre>
        $SIG{INT} = \&amp;ouch;</pre>
<pre>
        # or the name of the function as a string</pre>
<pre>
        $SIG{INT} = &quot;ouch&quot;;</pre>
<p>Perl versions before 5.8 had in its C source code signal handlers which
would catch the signal and possibly run a Perl function that you had set
in %SIG.  This violated the rules of signal handling at that level
causing perl to dump core. Since version 5.8.0, perl looks at %SIG
*after* the signal has been caught, rather than while it is being caught.
Previous versions of this answer were incorrect.</p>

<p>If perl was installed correctly and your shadow library was written
properly, the getpw*() functions described in <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc.html">the perlfunc manpage</a> should in
theory provide (read-only) access to entries in the shadow password

<code>pwd_mkdb(8)</code> to install it (see <em>pwd_mkdb</em> for more details).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_do_i_set_the_time_and_date">How do I set the time and date?</a></h2>
<p>Assuming you're running under sufficient permissions, you should be
able to set the system-wide date and time by running the <code>date(1)</code>
program.  (There is no way to set the time and date on a per-process
basis.)  This mechanism will work for Unix, MS-DOS, Windows, and NT;
the VMS equivalent is <code>set time</code>.</p>
<p>However, if all you want to do is change your time zone, you can
probably get away with setting an environment variable:</p>
<pre>
    $ENV{TZ} = &quot;MST7MDT&quot;;                  # unixish

<p>If you want finer granularity than the 1 second that the <code>sleep()</code>
function provides, the easiest way is to use the <code>select()</code> function as
documented in <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc/select.html">select in the perlfunc manpage</a>.  Try the Time::HiRes and
the BSD::Itimer modules (available from CPAN, and starting from

<h2><a name="how_can_i_measure_time_under_a_second">How can I measure time under a second?</a></h2>
<p>In general, you may not be able to.  The Time::HiRes module (available

<h2><a name="how_can_i_do_an_atexit___or_setjmp___longjmp____exception_handling_">How can I do an <code>atexit()</code> or setjmp()/longjmp()? (Exception handling)</a></h2>
<p>Release 5 of Perl added the END block, which can be used to simulate
atexit().  Each package's END block is called when the program or
thread ends (see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlmod.html">the perlmod manpage</a> manpage for more details).</p>
<p>For example, you can use this to make sure your filter program
managed to finish its output without filling up the disk:</p>
<pre>
    END {
        close(STDOUT) || die &quot;stdout close failed: $!&quot;;
    }</pre>
<p>The END block isn't called when untrapped signals kill the program,
though, so if you use END blocks you should also use</p>
<pre>
        use sigtrap qw(die normal-signals);</pre>
<p>Perl's exception-handling mechanism is its <code>eval()</code> operator.  You can
use <code>eval()</code> as setjmp and <code>die()</code> as longjmp.  For details of this, see
the section on signals, especially the time-out handler for a blocking
<code>flock()</code> in <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlipc/signals.html">Signals in the perlipc manpage</a> or the section on ``Signals'' in
the Camel Book.</p>
<p>If exception handling is all you're interested in, try the
exceptions.pl library (part of the standard perl distribution).</p>
<p>If you want the <code>atexit()</code> syntax (and an <code>rmexit()</code> as well), try the
AtExit module available from CPAN.</p>

<p>Some Sys-V based systems, notably Solaris 2.X, redefined some of the
standard socket constants.  Since these were constant across all
architectures, they were often hardwired into perl code.  The proper
way to deal with this is to ``use Socket'' to get the correct values.</p>
<p>Note that even though SunOS and Solaris are binary compatible, these
values are different.  Go figure.</p>

</p>
<h2><a name="how_can_i_call_my_system_s_unique_c_functions_from_perl">How can I call my system's unique C functions from Perl?</a></h2>
<p>In most cases, you write an external module to do it--see the answer
to ``Where can I learn about linking C with Perl? [h2xs, xsubpp]''.
However, if the function is a system call, and your system supports
syscall(), you can use the syscall function (documented in
<a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlfunc.html">the perlfunc manpage</a>).</p>
<p>Remember to check the modules that came with your distribution, and
CPAN as well---someone may already have written a module to do it. On
Windows, try Win32::API.  On Macs, try Mac::Carbon.  If no module
has an interface to the C function, you can inline a bit of C in your
Perl source with Inline::C.</p>

<h2><a name="where_do_i_get_the_include_files_to_do_ioctl___or_syscall__">Where do I get the include files to do <code>ioctl()</code> or syscall()?</a></h2>
<p>Historically, these would be generated by the h2ph tool, part of the
standard perl distribution.  This program converts <code>cpp(1)</code> directives
in C header files to files containing subroutine definitions, like
&amp;SYS_getitimer, which you can use as arguments to your functions.
It doesn't work perfectly, but it usually gets most of the job done.
Simple files like <em>errno.h</em>, <em>syscall.h</em>, and <em>socket.h</em> were fine,
but the hard ones like <em>ioctl.h</em> nearly always need to hand-edited.
Here's how to install the *.ph files:</p>
<pre>
    1.  become super-user
    2.  cd /usr/include
    3.  h2ph *.h */*.h</pre>
<p>If your system supports dynamic loading, for reasons of portability and
sanity you probably ought to use h2xs (also part of the standard perl
distribution).  This tool converts C header files to Perl extensions.
See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlxstut.html">the perlxstut manpage</a> for how to get started with h2xs.</p>
<p>If your system doesn't support dynamic loading, you still probably
ought to use h2xs.  See <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlxstut.html">the perlxstut manpage</a> and <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.html">the ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage</a> for

<h2><a name="why_do_setuid_perl_scripts_complain_about_kernel_problems">Why do setuid perl scripts complain about kernel problems?</a></h2>

<h2><a name="how_can_i_open_a_pipe_both_to_and_from_a_command">How can I open a pipe both to and from a command?</a></h2>
<p>The IPC::Open2 module (part of the standard perl distribution) is an
easy-to-use approach that internally uses pipe(), fork(), and <code>exec()</code> to do
the job.  Make sure you read the deadlock warnings in its documentation,
though (see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./lib/IPC/Open2.html">the IPC::Open2 manpage</a>).  See

<h2><a name="why_can_t_i_get_the_output_of_a_command_with_system__">Why can't I get the output of a command with system()?</a></h2>
<p>You're confusing the purpose of <code>system()</code> and backticks (``).  <code>system()</code>
runs a command and returns exit status information (as a 16 bit value:
the low 7 bits are the signal the process died from, if any, and
the high 8 bits are the actual exit value).  Backticks (``) run a
command and return what it sent to STDOUT.</p>
<pre>
    $exit_status   = system(&quot;mail-users&quot;);
    $output_string = `ls`;</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_can_i_capture_stderr_from_an_external_command">How can I capture STDERR from an external command?</a></h2>
<p>There are three basic ways of running external commands:</p>
<pre>
    system $cmd;                # using system()
    $output = `$cmd`;           # using backticks (``)
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd |&quot;);       # using open()</pre>
<p>With system(), both STDOUT and STDERR will go the same place as the
script's STDOUT and STDERR, unless the <code>system()</code> command redirects them.
Backticks and <code>open()</code> read <strong>only</strong> the STDOUT of your command.</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>open3()</code> function from IPC::Open3.  Benjamin
Goldberg provides some sample code:</p>
<p>To capture a program's STDOUT, but discard its STDERR:</p>
<pre>
    use IPC::Open3;
    use File::Spec;
    use Symbol qw(gensym);
    open(NULL, &quot;&gt;&quot;, File::Spec-&gt;devnull);
    my $pid = open3(gensym, \*PH, &quot;&gt;&amp;NULL&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;);
    while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
    waitpid($pid, 0);</pre>
<p>To capture a program's STDERR, but discard its STDOUT:</p>
<pre>
    use IPC::Open3;
    use File::Spec;
    use Symbol qw(gensym);
    open(NULL, &quot;&gt;&quot;, File::Spec-&gt;devnull);
    my $pid = open3(gensym, &quot;&gt;&amp;NULL&quot;, \*PH, &quot;cmd&quot;);
    while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
    waitpid($pid, 0);</pre>
<p>To capture a program's STDERR, and let its STDOUT go to our own STDERR:</p>
<pre>
    use IPC::Open3;
    use Symbol qw(gensym);
    my $pid = open3(gensym, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDERR&quot;, \*PH, &quot;cmd&quot;);
    while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
    waitpid($pid, 0);</pre>
<p>To read both a command's STDOUT and its STDERR separately, you can
redirect them to temp files, let the command run, then read the temp
files:</p>
<pre>
    use IPC::Open3;
    use Symbol qw(gensym);
    use IO::File;
    local *CATCHOUT = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
    local *CATCHERR = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
    my $pid = open3(gensym, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHOUT&quot;, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHERR&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;);
    waitpid($pid, 0);
    seek $_, 0, 0 for \*CATCHOUT, \*CATCHERR;
    while( &lt;CATCHOUT&gt; ) {}
    while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}</pre>
<p>But there's no real need for *both* to be tempfiles... the following
should work just as well, without deadlocking:</p>
<pre>
    use IPC::Open3;
    use Symbol qw(gensym);
    use IO::File;
    local *CATCHERR = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
    my $pid = open3(gensym, \*CATCHOUT, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHERR&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;);
    while( &lt;CATCHOUT&gt; ) {}
    waitpid($pid, 0);
    seek CATCHERR, 0, 0;
    while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}</pre>
<p>And it'll be faster, too, since we can begin processing the program's
stdout immediately, rather than waiting for the program to finish.</p>
<p>With any of these, you can change file descriptors before the call:</p>
<pre>
    open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;logfile&quot;);
    system(&quot;ls&quot;);</pre>
<p>or you can use Bourne shell file-descriptor redirection:</p>
<pre>
    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;some_file`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;some_file |&quot;);</pre>
<p>You can also use file-descriptor redirection to make STDERR a
duplicate of STDOUT:</p>
<pre>
    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 |&quot;);</pre>
<p>Note that you <em>cannot</em> simply open STDERR to be a dup of STDOUT
in your Perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection.
This doesn't work:</p>
<pre>
    open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;);
    $alloutput = `cmd args`;  # stderr still escapes</pre>
<p>This fails because the <code>open()</code> makes STDERR go to where STDOUT was
going at the time of the open().  The backticks then make STDOUT go to
a string, but don't change STDERR (which still goes to the old
STDOUT).</p>
<p>Note that you <em>must</em> use Bourne shell (sh(1)) redirection syntax in
backticks, not csh(1)!  Details on why Perl's <code>system()</code> and backtick
and pipe opens all use the Bourne shell are in the
<em>versus/csh.whynot</em> article in the ``Far More Than You Ever Wanted To
Know'' collection in <a href="http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz">http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz</a> .  To

    $pid = open(PH, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;/dev/null |&quot;);  # or with an open pipe
    while (&lt;PH&gt;) { }                            #    plus a read</pre>
<p>To exchange a command's STDOUT and STDERR in order to capture the STDERR
but leave its STDOUT to come out our old STDERR:</p>

<p>To read both a command's STDOUT and its STDERR separately, it's easiest
to redirect them separately to files, and then read from those files
when the program is done:</p>
<pre>
    system(&quot;program args 1&gt;program.stdout 2&gt;program.stderr&quot;);</pre>
<p>Ordering is important in all these examples.  That's because the shell
processes file descriptor redirections in strictly left to right order.</p>
<pre>
    system(&quot;prog args 1&gt;tmpfile 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;);
    system(&quot;prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;tmpfile&quot;);</pre>
<p>The first command sends both standard out and standard error to the
temporary file.  The second command sends only the old standard output
there, and the old standard error shows up on the old standard out.</p>

successfully started.  You can still capture the shell's STDERR and
check it for error messages.  See <a href="#how_can_i_capture_stderr_from_an_external_command">How can I capture STDERR from an external command?</a> elsewhere in this document, or use the
IPC::Open3 module.</p>
<p>If there are no shell metacharacters in the argument of open(), Perl
runs the command directly, without using the shell, and can correctly
report whether the command started.</p>

<h2><a name="what_s_wrong_with_using_backticks_in_a_void_context">What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?</a></h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, nothing.  Stylistically speaking, it's not a good
way to write maintainable code.  Perl has several operators for
running external commands.  Backticks are one; they collect the output
from the command for use in your program.  The <code>system</code> function is
another; it doesn't do this.</p>
<p>Writing backticks in your program sends a clear message to the readers
of your code that you wanted to collect the output of the command.
Why send a clear message that isn't true?</p>
<p>Consider this line:</p>
<pre>
    `cat /etc/termcap`;</pre>
<p>You forgot to check <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlvar.html#item__"><code>$?</code></a> to see whether the program even ran
correctly.  Even if you wrote</p>
<pre>
    print `cat /etc/termcap`;</pre>
<p>this code could and probably should be written as</p>
<pre>
    system(&quot;cat /etc/termcap&quot;) == 0
        or die &quot;cat program failed!&quot;;</pre>
<p>which will get the output quickly (as it is generated, instead of only
at the end) and also check the return value.</p>
<p><code>system()</code> also provides direct control over whether shell wildcard
processing may take place, whereas backticks do not.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_can_i_call_backticks_without_shell_processing">How can I call backticks without shell processing?</a></h2>
<p>This is a bit tricky.  You can't simply write the command
like this:</p>
<pre>
    @ok = `grep @opts '$search_string' @filenames`;</pre>
<p>As of Perl 5.8.0, you can use <code>open()</code> with multiple arguments.
Just like the list forms of <code>system()</code> and exec(), no shell
escapes happen.</p>
<pre>
   open( GREP, &quot;-|&quot;, 'grep', @opts, $search_string, @filenames );
   chomp(@ok = &lt;GREP&gt;);
   close GREP;</pre>
<p>You can also:</p>
<pre>
    my @ok = ();
    if (open(GREP, &quot;-|&quot;)) {
        while (&lt;GREP&gt;) {
            chomp;
            push(@ok, $_);
        }
        close GREP;
    } else {
        exec 'grep', @opts, $search_string, @filenames;
    }</pre>
<p>Just as with system(), no shell escapes happen when you <code>exec()</code> a list.
Further examples of this can be found in <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./pod/perlipc/safe_pipe_opens.html">Safe Pipe Opens in the perlipc manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Note that if you're use Microsoft, no solution to this vexing issue
is even possible.  Even if Perl were to emulate fork(), you'd still
be stuck, because Microsoft does not have a argc/argv-style API.</p>

<p>Learn Perl and rewrite it.  Seriously, there's no simple converter.
Things that are awkward to do in the shell are easy to do in Perl, and
this very awkwardness is what would make a shell-&gt;perl converter
nigh-on impossible to write.  By rewriting it, you'll think about what
you're really trying to do, and hopefully will escape the shell's
pipeline datastream paradigm, which while convenient for some matters,
causes many inefficiencies.</p>

<p>First of all note that if you're doing this for security reasons (to
avoid people seeing passwords, for example) then you should rewrite
your program so that critical information is never given as an

secure.</p>
<p>To actually alter the visible command line, you can assign to the

<h2><a name="how_do_i_tell_the_difference_between_errors_from_the_shell_and_perl">How do I tell the difference between errors from the shell and perl?</a></h2>
<p>(answer contributed by brian d foy, <code>&lt;bdfoy@cpan.org&gt;</code></p>
<p>When you run a Perl script, something else is running the script for you,
and that something else may output error messages.  The script might
emit its own warnings and error messages.  Most of the time you cannot
tell who said what.</p>
<p>You probably cannot fix the thing that runs perl, but you can change how
perl outputs its warnings by defining a custom warning and die functions.</p>
<p>Consider this script, which has an error you may not notice immediately.</p>
<pre>
        #!/usr/locl/bin/perl</pre>
<pre>
        print &quot;Hello World\n&quot;;</pre>
<p>I get an error when I run this from my shell (which happens to be
bash).  That may look like perl forgot it has a <code>print()</code> function,
but my shebang line is not the path to perl, so the shell runs the
script, and I get the error.</p>
<pre>
        $ ./test
        ./test: line 3: print: command not found</pre>
<p>A quick and dirty fix involves a little bit of code, but this may be all
you need to figure out the problem.</p>
<pre>
        #!/usr/bin/perl -w</pre>
<pre>
        BEGIN {
        $SIG{__WARN__} = sub{ print STDERR &quot;Perl: &quot;, @_; };
        $SIG{__DIE__}  = sub{ print STDERR &quot;Perl: &quot;, @_; exit 1};
        }</pre>
<pre>
        $a = 1 + undef;
        $x / 0;
        __END__</pre>
<p>The perl message comes out with ``Perl'' in front.  The BEGIN block
works at compile time so all of the compilation errors and warnings
get the ``Perl:'' prefix too.</p>
<pre>
        Perl: Useless use of division (/) in void context at ./test line 9.
        Perl: Name &quot;main::a&quot; used only once: possible typo at ./test line 8.
        Perl: Name &quot;main::x&quot; used only once: possible typo at ./test line 9.
        Perl: Use of uninitialized value in addition (+) at ./test line 8.

        Perl: Illegal division by zero at ./test line 9.
        Perl: Illegal division by zero at -e line 3.</pre>
<p>If I don't see that ``Perl:'', it's not from perl.</p>
<p>You could also just know all the perl errors, and although there are
some people who may know all of them, you probably don't.  However, they
all should be in the perldiag manpage. If you don't find the error in
there, it probably isn't a perl error.</p>
<p>Looking up every message is not the easiest way, so let perl to do it

<h2><a name="what_s_the_difference_between_require_and_use">What's the difference between require and use?</a></h2>
<p>Perl offers several different ways to include code from one file into
another.  Here are the deltas between the various inclusion constructs:</p>
<pre>
    1)  do $file is like eval `cat $file`, except the former
        1.1: searches @INC and updates %INC.
        1.2: bequeaths an *unrelated* lexical scope on the eval'ed code.</pre>
<pre>
    2)  require $file is like do $file, except the former
        2.1: checks for redundant loading, skipping already loaded files.
        2.2: raises an exception on failure to find, compile, or execute $file.</pre>
<pre>
    3)  require Module is like require &quot;Module.pm&quot;, except the former
        3.1: translates each &quot;::&quot; into your system's directory separator.
        3.2: primes the parser to disambiguate class Module as an indirect object.</pre>
<pre>
    4)  use Module is like require Module, except the former
        4.1: loads the module at compile time, not run-time.
        4.2: imports symbols and semantics from that package to the current one.</pre>
