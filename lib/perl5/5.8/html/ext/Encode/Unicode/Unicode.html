<p><em>Character Encoding Scheme</em> A character encoding form plus byte
serialization. There are Seven character encoding schemes in Unicode:
UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32 (UCS-4), UTF-32BE (UCS-4BE) and
UTF-32LE (UCS-4LE), and UTF-7.</p>

<p>Since UTF-7 is a 7-bit (re)encoded version of UTF-16BE, It is not part of
Unicode's Character Encoding Scheme.  It is separately implemented in
Encode::Unicode::UTF7.  For details see <a href="/usr/lib/perl5/5.8/html/./ext/Encode/lib/Encode/Unicode/UTF7.html">the Encode::Unicode::UTF7 manpage</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="size__endianness__and_bom">Size, Endianness, and BOM</a></h1>
<p>You can categorize these CES by 3 criteria:  size of each character,
endianness, and Byte Order Mark.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="by_size">by size</a></h2>
<p>UCS-2 is a fixed-length encoding with each character taking 16 bits.
It <strong>does not</strong> support <em>surrogate pairs</em>.  When a surrogate pair
is encountered during decode(), its place is filled with \x{FFFD}
if <em>CHECK</em> is 0, or the routine croaks if <em>CHECK</em> is 1.  When a
character whose ord value is larger than 0xFFFF is encountered,
its place is filled with \x{FFFD} if <em>CHECK</em> is 0, or the routine
croaks if <em>CHECK</em> is 1.</p>
<p>UTF-16 is almost the same as UCS-2 but it supports <em>surrogate pairs</em>.
When it encounters a high surrogate (0xD800-0xDBFF), it fetches the
following low surrogate (0xDC00-0xDFFF) and <code>desurrogate</code>s them to
form a character.  Bogus surrogates result in death.  When \x{10000}
or above is encountered during encode(), it <code>ensurrogate</code>s them and
pushes the surrogate pair to the output stream.</p>
<p>UTF-32 (UCS-4) is a fixed-length encoding with each character taking 32 bits.
Since it is 32-bit, there is no need for <em>surrogate pairs</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="by_endianness">by endianness</a></h2>
<p>The first (and now failed) goal of Unicode was to map all character
repertoires into a fixed-length integer so that programmers are happy.
Since each character is either a <em>short</em> or <em>long</em> in C, you have to
pay attention to the endianness of each platform when you pass data
to one another.</p>
<p>Anything marked as BE is Big Endian (or network byte order) and LE is
Little Endian (aka VAX byte order).  For anything not marked either
BE or LE, a character called Byte Order Mark (BOM) indicating the
endianness is prepended to the string.</p>
<p>CAVEAT: Though BOM in utf8 (\xEF\xBB\xBF) is valid, it is meaningless
and as of this writing Encode suite just leave it as is (\x{FeFF}).</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bom_as_integer_when_fetched_in_network_byte_order">BOM as integer when fetched in network byte order</a></strong>

<dd>
<pre>
              16         32 bits/char
  -------------------------
  BE      0xFeFF 0x0000FeFF
  LE      0xFFeF 0xFFFe0000
  -------------------------</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This modules handles the BOM as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When BE or LE is explicitly stated as the name of encoding, BOM is
simply treated as a normal character (ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When BE or LE is omitted during decode(), it checks if BOM is at the
beginning of the string; if one is found, the endianness is set to
what the BOM says.  If no BOM is found, the routine dies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When BE or LE is omitted during encode(), it returns a BE-encoded
string with BOM prepended.  So when you want to encode a whole text
file, make sure you <code>encode()</code> the whole text at once, not line by line
or each line, not file, will have a BOM prepended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>UCS-2</code> is an exception.  Unlike others, this is an alias of UCS-2BE.
UCS-2 is already registered by IANA and others that way.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="surrogate_pairs">Surrogate Pairs</a></h1>
<p>To say the least, surrogate pairs were the biggest mistake of the
Unicode Consortium.  But according to the late Douglas Adams in <em>The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> Trilogy, <code>In the beginning the
Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and
been widely regarded as a bad move</code>.  Their mistake was not of this
magnitude so let's forgive them.</p>
<p>(I don't dare make any comparison with Unicode Consortium and the
Vogons here ;)  Or, comparing Encode to Babel Fish is completely
appropriate -- if you can only stick this into your ear :)</p>
<p>Surrogate pairs were born when the Unicode Consortium finally
admitted that 16 bits were not big enough to hold all the world's
character repertoires.  But they already made UCS-2 16-bit.  What
do we do?</p>
<p>Back then, the range 0xD800-0xDFFF was not allocated.  Let's split
that range in half and use the first half to represent the <code>upper
half of a character</code> and the second half to represent the <code>lower
half of a character</code>.  That way, you can represent 1024 * 1024 =
1048576 more characters.  Now we can store character ranges up to
\x{10ffff} even with 16-bit encodings.  This pair of half-character is
now called a <em>surrogate pair</em> and UTF-16 is the name of the encoding
that embraces them.</p>
<p>Here is a formula to ensurrogate a Unicode character \x{10000} and
above;</p>
<pre>
  $hi = ($uni - 0x10000) / 0x400 + 0xD800;
  $lo = ($uni - 0x10000) % 0x400 + 0xDC00;</pre>
<p>And to desurrogate;</p>
<pre>
 $uni = 0x10000 + ($hi - 0xD800) * 0x400 + ($lo - 0xDC00);</pre>
<p>Note this move has made \x{D800}-\x{DFFF} into a forbidden zone but
perl does not prohibit the use of characters within this range.  To perl, 
every one of \x{0000_0000} up to \x{ffff_ffff} (*) is <em>a character</em>.</p>
<pre>
  (*) or \x{ffff_ffff_ffff_ffff} if your perl is compiled with 64-bit
  integer support!</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="error_checking">Error Checking</a></h1>
<p>Unlike most encodings which accept various ways to handle errors,
Unicode encodings simply croaks.</p>
<pre>
  % perl -MEncode -e '$_ = &quot;\xfe\xff\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\0\n&quot;' \
         -e 'Encode::from_to($_, &quot;utf16&quot;,&quot;shift_jis&quot;, 0); print'
  UTF-16:Malformed LO surrogate d8d9 at /path/to/Encode.pm line 184.
  % perl -MEncode -e '$a = &quot;BOM missing&quot;' \
         -e ' Encode::from_to($a, &quot;utf16&quot;, &quot;shift_jis&quot;, 0); print'
  UTF-16:Unrecognised BOM 424f at /path/to/Encode.pm line 184.</pre>
<p>Unlike other encodings where mappings are not one-to-one against
Unicode, UTFs are supposed to map 100% against one another.  So Encode
is more strict on UTFs.</p>
<p>Consider that ``division by zero'' of Encode :)</p>
