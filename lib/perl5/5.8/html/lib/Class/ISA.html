<p>Class::ISA -- report the search path for a class's ISA tree</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>
  # Suppose you go: use Food::Fishstick, and that uses and
  # inherits from other things, which in turn use and inherit
  # from other things.  And suppose, for sake of brevity of
  # example, that their ISA tree is the same as:</pre>
<pre>
  @Food::Fishstick::ISA = qw(Food::Fish  Life::Fungus  Chemicals);
  @Food::Fish::ISA = qw(Food);
  @Food::ISA = qw(Matter);
  @Life::Fungus::ISA = qw(Life);
  @Chemicals::ISA = qw(Matter);
  @Life::ISA = qw(Matter);
  @Matter::ISA = qw();</pre>
<pre>
  use Class::ISA;
  print &quot;Food::Fishstick path is:\n &quot;,
        join(&quot;, &quot;, Class::ISA::super_path('Food::Fishstick')),
        &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>
<p>That prints:</p>
<pre>
  Food::Fishstick path is:
   Food::Fish, Food, Matter, Life::Fungus, Life, Chemicals</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived,
via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick
is from Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those
superclasses may themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or
more superclasses (as above).</p>
<p>When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick-&gt;calories),
Perl first searches there for that method, but if it's not there, it
goes searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or
maybe ``height-first'' is the word) search.  In the above example, it'd
first look in Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus,
then Life, then Chemicals.</p>
<p>This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list --
the list (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a
method, with no duplicates.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="functions">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_super_path">the function Class::ISA::super_path($CLASS)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This returns the ordered list of names of classes that Perl would
search thru in order to find a method, with no duplicates in the list.
$CLASS is not included in the list.  UNIVERSAL is not included -- if
you need to consider it, add it to the end.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_self_and_super_path">the function Class::ISA::self_and_super_path($CLASS)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Just like <a href="#item_super_path"><code>super_path</code></a>, except that $CLASS is included as the first
element.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_self_and_super_versions">the function Class::ISA::self_and_super_versions($CLASS)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This returns a hash whose keys are $CLASS and its
(super-)superclasses, and whose values are the contents of each
class's $VERSION (or undef, for classes with no $VERSION).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The code for self_and_super_versions is meant to serve as an example
for precisely the kind of tasks I anticipate that self_and_super_path
and super_path will be used for.  You are strongly advised to read the
source for self_and_super_versions, and the comments there.</p>

<h1><a name="cautionary_notes">CAUTIONARY NOTES</a></h1>
<p>* Class::ISA doesn't export anything.  You have to address the
functions with a ``Class::ISA::'' on the front.</p>
<p>* Contrary to its name, Class::ISA isn't a class; it's just a package.
Strange, isn't it?</p>
<p>* Say you have a loop in the ISA tree of the class you're calling one
of the Class::ISA functions on: say that Food inherits from Matter,
but Matter inherits from Food (for sake of argument).  If Perl, while
searching for a method, actually discovers this cyclicity, it will
throw a fatal error.  The functions in Class::ISA effectively ignore
this cyclicity; the Class::ISA algorithm is ``never go down the same
path twice'', and cyclicities are just a special case of that.</p>
<p>* The Class::ISA functions just look at @ISAs.  But theoretically, I
suppose, AUTOLOADs could bypass Perl's ISA-based search mechanism and
do whatever they please.  That would be bad behavior, tho; and I try
not to think about that.</p>
<p>* If Perl can't find a method anywhere in the ISA tree, it then looks
in the magical class UNIVERSAL.  This is rarely relevant to the tasks
that I expect Class::ISA functions to be put to, but if it matters to
you, then instead of this:</p>
<pre>
  @supers = Class::Tree::super_path($class);</pre>
<p>do this:</p>
<pre>
  @supers = (Class::Tree::super_path($class), 'UNIVERSAL');</pre>
<p>And don't say no-one ever told ya!</p>
<p>* When you call them, the Class::ISA functions look at @ISAs anew --
that is, there is no memoization, and so if ISAs change during
runtime, you get the current ISA tree's path, not anything memoized.
However, changing ISAs at runtime is probably a sign that you're out
of your mind!</p>
