=head1 NAME

Config - access Perl configuration information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Config;
    if ($Config{usethreads}) {
	print "has thread support\n"
    } 

    use Config qw(myconfig config_sh config_vars config_re);

    print myconfig();

    print config_sh();

    print config_re();

    config_vars(qw(osname archname));


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Config module contains all the information that was available to
the C<Configure> program at Perl build time (over 900 values).

Shell variables from the F<config.sh> file (written by Configure) are
stored in the readonly-variable C<%Config>, indexed by their names.

Values stored in config.sh as 'undef' are returned as undefined
values.  The perl C<exists> function can be used to check if a
named variable exists.

=over 4

=item myconfig()

Returns a textual summary of the major perl configuration values.
See also C<-V> in L<perlrun/Switches>.

=item config_sh()

Returns the entire perl configuration information in the form of the
original config.sh shell variable assignment script.

=item config_re($regex)

Like config_sh() but returns, as a list, only the config entries who's
names match the $regex.

=item config_vars(@names)

Prints to STDOUT the values of the named configuration variable. Each is
printed on a separate line in the form:

  name='value';

Names which are unknown are output as C<name='UNKNOWN';>.
See also C<-V:name> in L<perlrun/Switches>.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Here's a more sophisticated example of using %Config:

    use Config;
    use strict;

    my %sig_num;
    my @sig_name;
    unless($Config{sig_name} && $Config{sig_num}) {
	die "No sigs?";
    } else {
	my @names = split ' ', $Config{sig_name};
	@sig_num{@names} = split ' ', $Config{sig_num};
	foreach (@names) {
	    $sig_name[$sig_num{$_}] ||= $_;
	}   
    }

    print "signal #17 = $sig_name[17]\n";
    if ($sig_num{ALRM}) { 
	print "SIGALRM is $sig_num{ALRM}\n";
    }   

=head1 WARNING

Because this information is not stored within the perl executable
itself it is possible (but unlikely) that the information does not
relate to the actual perl binary which is being used to access it.

The Config module is installed into the architecture and version
specific library directory ($Config{installarchlib}) and it checks the
perl version number when loaded.

The values stored in config.sh may be either single-quoted or
double-quoted. Double-quoted strings are handy for those cases where you
need to include escape sequences in the strings. To avoid runtime variable
interpolation, any C<$> and C<@> characters are replaced by C<\$> and
C<\@>, respectively. This isn't foolproof, of course, so don't embed C<\$>
or C<\@> in double-quoted strings unless you're willing to deal with the
consequences. (The slashes will end up escaped and the C<$> or C<@> will
trigger variable interpolation)

=head1 GLOSSARY

Most C<Config> variables are determined by the C<Configure> script
on platforms supported by it (which is most UNIX platforms).  Some
platforms have custom-made C<Config> variables, and may thus not have
some of the variables described below, or may have extraneous variables
specific to that particular port.  See the port specific documentation
in such cases.

=head2 _

=over 4

=item C<_a>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines the extension used for ordinary library files.
For unix, it is F<.a>.  The F<.> is included.  Other possible
values include F<.lib>.

=item C<_exe>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines the extension used for executable files.
C<DJGPP>, Cygwin and F<OS/2> use F<.exe>.  Stratus C<VOS> uses F<.pm>.
On operating systems which do not require a specific extension
for executable files, this variable is empty.

=item C<_o>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines the extension used for object files.
For unix, it is F<.o>.  The F<.> is included.  Other possible
values include F<.obj>.

=back

=head2 a

=over 4

=item C<afs>

From F<afs.U>:

This variable is set to C<true> if C<AFS> (Andrew File System) is used
on the system, C<false> otherwise.  It is possible to override this
with a hint value or command line option, but you'd better know
what you are doing.

=item C<afsroot>

From F<afs.U>:

This variable is by default set to F</afs>. In the unlikely case
this is not the correct root, it is possible to override this with
a hint value or command line option.  This will be used in subsequent
tests for AFSness in the Perl configure and test process. 

=item C<alignbytes>

From F<alignbytes.U>:

This variable holds the number of bytes required to align a
double-- or a long double when applicable. Usual values are
2, 4 and 8.  The default is eight, for safety.

=item C<ansi2knr>

From F<ansi2knr.U>:

This variable is set if the user needs to run ansi2knr.  
Currently, this is not supported, so we just abort.

=item C<aphostname>

From F<d_gethname.U>:

This variable contains the command which can be used to compute the
host name. The command is fully qualified by its absolute path, to make
it safe when used by a process with super-user privileges.

=item C<api_revision>

From F<patchlevel.U>:

The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
such as F<5.6.1>, api_revision is the C<5>.
Prior to 5.5.640, the format was a floating point number,
like 5.00563.

F<perl.c>:incpush() and F<lib/lib.pm> will automatically search in
F<$sitelib/.>. for older directories back to the limit specified
by these api_ variables.  This is only useful if you have a
perl library directory tree structured like the default one.
See C<INSTALL> for how this works.  The versioned site_perl
directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the lowest
possible value.  The version list appropriate for the current
system is determined in F<inc_version_list.U>.

C<XXX> To do:  Since compatibility can depend on compile time
options (such as bincompat, longlong, etc.) it should
(perhaps) be set by Configure, but currently it isn't.
Currently, we read a hard-wired value from F<patchlevel.h>.
Perhaps what we ought to do is take the hard-wired value from
F<patchlevel.h> but then modify it if the current Configure
options warrant.  F<patchlevel.h> then would use an #ifdef guard.

=item C<api_subversion>

From F<patchlevel.U>:

The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
such as F<5.6.1>, api_subversion is the C<1>.  See api_revision for
full details.

=item C<api_version>

From F<patchlevel.U>:

The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
such as F<5.6.1>, api_version is the C<6>.  See api_revision for
full details.  As a special case, 5.5.0 is rendered in the
old-style as 5.005.  (In the 5.005_0x maintenance series,
this was the only versioned directory in $sitelib.)

=item C<api_versionstring>

From F<patchlevel.U>:

This variable combines api_revision, api_version, and
api_subversion in a format such as 5.6.1 (or 5_6_1) suitable
for use as a directory name.  This is filesystem dependent.

=item C<ar>

This variable defines any additional objects that must be linked
in with the program on this architecture.  On unix, it is usually
empty.  It is typically used to include emulations of unix calls
or other facilities.  For perl on F<OS/2>, for example, this would
include F<os2/os2.obj>.

=item C<asctime_r_proto>

From F<d_asctime_r.U>:

This variable encodes the prototype of asctime_r.

is defined.

=item C<awk>

From F<Loc.U>:

long doubles, the macro uses the first of the following
functions that pass Configure's tests: qgcvt, sprintf (if
Configure knows how to make sprintf format long doubles--see
sPRIgldbl), gconvert, gcvt, and sprintf (casting to double).

long doubles, respectively.  If present, they contain a       
space-separated list of one or more of the above function       
names in the order they should be tried.

=item C<installstyle>

From F<installstyle.U>:

This variable describes the C<style> of the perl installation.
This is intended to be useful for tools that need to
manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use
this to find its libraries -- the library directories are
stored directly in F<Config.pm>.  Currently, there are only two
styles:  C<lib> and F<lib/perl5>.  The default library locations
(e.g. privlib, sitelib) are either F<$prefix/lib> or
F<$prefix/lib/perl5>.  The former is useful if $prefix is a
directory dedicated to perl (e.g. F</opt/perl>), while the latter
is useful if $prefix is shared by many packages, e.g. if
$prefix=F</usr/local>.

Unfortunately, while this C<style> variable is used to set
defaults for all three directory hierarchies (core, vendor, and
site), there is no guarantee that the same style is actually
appropriate for all those directories.  For example, $prefix
might be F</opt/perl>, but $siteprefix might be F</usr/local>.
(Perhaps, in retrospect, the C<lib> style should never have been
supported, but it did seem like a nice idea at the time.)

The situation is even less clear for tools such as MakeMaker
that can be used to install additional modules into
non-standard places.  For example, if a user intends to install
a module into a private directory (perhaps by setting C<PREFIX> on
the F<Makefile.PL> command line), then there is no reason to
assume that the Configure-time $installstyle setting will be
relevant for that C<PREFIX>.

This may later be extended to include other information, so
be careful with pattern-matching on the results.

For compatibility with F<perl5.005> and earlier, the default
setting is based on whether or not $prefix contains the string
C<perl>.
