=head1 Changes

This is just a selected list of some of the more notable changes.
The numbers refer to the Perl repository change numbers; see
L<Changes58> (or L<Changes> in Perl 5.8.1).  In addition to these
changes, lots of work took place in integrating threads, PerlIO, and
Unicode; general code cleanup; and last but not least porting to
non-UNIX lands such as Win32, VMS, Cygwin, DJGPP, VOS, MacOS Classic,
and EBCDIC.
