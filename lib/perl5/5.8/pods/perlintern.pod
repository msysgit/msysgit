perlintern - autogenerated documentation of purely B<internal>
		 Perl functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION
X<internal Perl functions> X<interpreter functions>

This file is the autogenerated documentation of functions in the
Perl interpreter that are documented using Perl's internal documentation
format but are not marked as part of the Perl API. In other words,
B<they are not for use in extensions>!


=head1 CV reference counts and CvOUTSIDE

=over 8

=item CvWEAKOUTSIDE
X<CvWEAKOUTSIDE>

Each CV has a pointer, C<CvOUTSIDE()>, to its lexically enclosing
CV (if any). Because pointers to anonymous sub prototypes are
stored in C<&> pad slots, it is a possible to get a circular reference,
with the parent pointing to the child and vice-versa. To avoid the
ensuing memory leak, we do not increment the reference count of the CV
pointed to by C<CvOUTSIDE> in the I<one specific instance> that the parent
has a C<&> pad slot pointing back to us. In this case, we set the
C<CvWEAKOUTSIDE> flag in the child. This allows us to determine under what
circumstances we should decrement the refcount of the parent when freeing
the child.

There is a further complication with non-closure anonymous subs (i.e. those
that do not refer to any lexicals outside that sub). In this case, the
anonymous prototype is shared rather than being cloned. This has the
consequence that the parent may be freed while there are still active
children, eg

    BEGIN { $a = sub { eval '$x' } }

In this case, the BEGIN is freed immediately after execution since there
are no active references to it: the anon sub prototype has
C<CvWEAKOUTSIDE> set since it's not a closure, and $a points to the same
CV, so it doesn't contribute to BEGIN's refcount either.  When $a is
executed, the C<eval '$x'> causes the chain of C<CvOUTSIDE>s to be followed,
and the freed BEGIN is accessed.

To avoid this, whenever a CV and its associated pad is freed, any
C<&> entries in the pad are explicitly removed from the pad, and if the
refcount of the pointed-to anon sub is still positive, then that
child's C<CvOUTSIDE> is set to point to its grandparent. This will only
occur in the single specific case of a non-closure anon prototype
having one or more active references (such as C<$a> above).

One other thing to consider is that a CV may be merely undefined
rather than freed, eg C<undef &foo>. In this case, its refcount may
not have reached zero, but we still delete its pad and its C<CvROOT> etc.
Since various children may still have their C<CvOUTSIDE> pointing at this
undefined CV, we keep its own C<CvOUTSIDE> for the time being, so that
the chain of lexical scopes is unbroken. For example, the following
should print 123:

    my $x = 123;
    sub tmp { sub { eval '$x' } }
    my $a = tmp();
    undef &tmp;
    print  $a->();

=head1 Pad Data Structures

=over 8

=item CvPADLIST
X<CvPADLIST>

CV's can have CvPADLIST(cv) set to point to an AV.

For these purposes "forms" are a kind-of CV, eval""s are too (except they're
not callable at will and are always thrown away after the eval"" is done
executing).

XSUBs don't have CvPADLIST set - dXSTARG fetches values from PL_curpad,
but that is really the callers pad (a slot of which is allocated by
every entersub).

The CvPADLIST AV has does not have AvREAL set, so REFCNT of component items
is managed "manual" (mostly in pad.c) rather than normal av.c rules.
The items in the AV are not SVs as for a normal AV, but other AVs:

0'th Entry of the CvPADLIST is an AV which represents the "names" or rather
the "static type information" for lexicals.

The CvDEPTH'th entry of CvPADLIST AV is an AV which is the stack frame at that
depth of recursion into the CV.
The 0'th slot of a frame AV is an AV which is @_.
other entries are storage for variables and op targets.

During compilation:
C<PL_comppad_name> is set to the names AV.
C<PL_comppad> is set to the frame AV for the frame CvDEPTH == 1.
C<PL_curpad> is set to the body of the frame AV (i.e. AvARRAY(PL_comppad)).

During execution, C<PL_comppad> and C<PL_curpad> refer to the live
frame of the currently executing sub.

Iterating over the names AV iterates over all possible pad
items. Pad slots that are SVs_PADTMP (targets/GVs/constants) end up having
&PL_sv_undef "names" (see pad_alloc()).

Only my/our variable (SVs_PADMY/SVs_PADOUR) slots get valid names.
The rest are op targets/GVs/constants which are statically allocated
or resolved at compile time.  These don't have names by which they
can be looked up from Perl code at run time through eval"" like
my/our variables can be.  Since they can't be looked up by "name"
but only by their index allocated at compile time (which is usually
in PL_op->op_targ), wasting a name SV for them doesn't make sense.

The SVs in the names AV have their PV being the name of the variable.
NV+1..IV inclusive is a range of cop_seq numbers for which the name is
valid.  For typed lexicals name SV is SVt_PVMG and SvSTASH points at the
type.  For C<our> lexicals, the type is SVt_PVGV, and GvSTASH points at the
stash of the associated global (so that duplicate C<our> declarations in the
same package can be detected).  SvCUR is sometimes hijacked to
store the generation number during compilation.

If SvFAKE is set on the name SV then slot in the frame AVs are
a REFCNT'ed references to a lexical from "outside". In this case,
the name SV does not have a cop_seq range, since it is in scope
throughout.

If the 'name' is '&' the corresponding entry in frame AV
is a CV representing a possible closure.
(SvFAKE and name of '&' is not a meaningful combination currently but could
become so if C<my sub foo {}> is implemented.)

The flag SVf_PADSTALE is cleared on lexicals each time the my() is executed,
and set on scope exit. This allows the 'Variable $x is not available' warning
to be generated in evals, such as 

    { my $x = 1; sub f { eval '$x'} } f();
