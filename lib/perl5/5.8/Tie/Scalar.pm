=head1 NAME

Tie::Scalar, Tie::StdScalar - base class definitions for tied scalars

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package NewScalar;
    require Tie::Scalar;

    @ISA = (Tie::Scalar);

    sub FETCH { ... }		# Provide a needed method
    sub TIESCALAR { ... }	# Overrides inherited method


    package NewStdScalar;
    require Tie::Scalar;

    @ISA = (Tie::StdScalar);

    # All methods provided by default, so define only what needs be overridden
    sub FETCH { ... }


    package main;

    tie $new_scalar, 'NewScalar';
    tie $new_std_scalar, 'NewStdScalar';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides some skeletal methods for scalar-tying classes. See
L<perltie> for a list of the functions required in tying a scalar to a
package. The basic B<Tie::Scalar> package provides a C<new> method, as well
as methods C<TIESCALAR>, C<FETCH> and C<STORE>. The B<Tie::StdScalar>
package provides all the methods specified in  L<perltie>. It inherits from
B<Tie::Scalar> and causes scalars tied to it to behave exactly like the
built-in scalars, allowing for selective overloading of methods. The C<new>
method is provided as a means of grandfathering, for classes that forget to
provide their own C<TIESCALAR> method.

For developers wishing to write their own tied-scalar classes, the methods
are summarized below. The L<perltie> section not only documents these, but
has sample code as well:

=over 4

=item TIESCALAR classname, LIST

The method invoked by the command C<tie $scalar, classname>. Associates a new
scalar instance with the specified class. C<LIST> would represent additional
arguments (along the lines of L<AnyDBM_File> and compatriots) needed to
complete the association.

=item FETCH this

Retrieve the value of the tied scalar referenced by I<this>.

=item STORE this, value

Store data I<value> in the tied scalar referenced by I<this>.

=item DESTROY this

Free the storage associated with the tied scalar referenced by I<this>.
This is rarely needed, as Perl manages its memory quite well. But the
option exists, should a class wish to perform specific actions upon the
destruction of an instance.

=head1 MORE INFORMATION

The L<perltie> section uses a good example of tying scalars by associating
process IDs with priority.
