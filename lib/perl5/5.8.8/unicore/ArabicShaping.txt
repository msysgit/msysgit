# This file is a normative contributory data file in the

#
# This file defines the shaping classes for Arabic and Syriac
# positional shaping, repeating in machine readable form the
# information printed in Tables 8-3, 8-7, 8-8, 8-11, 8-12, and
# 8-13 of The Unicode Standard, Version 4.0.
#
# See sections 8.2 and 8.3 of The Unicode Standard, Version 4.0
# for more information.
#
# Each line contains four fields, separated by a semicolon.
#
# Field 0: the code point, in 4-digit hexadecimal
#   form, of an Arabic or Syriac character.
# Field 1: gives a short schematic name for that character,
#   abbreviated from the normative Unicode character name.
# Field 2: defines the joining type (property name: Joining_Type)
#   R Right_Joining
#   L Left_Joining
#   D Dual_Joining
#   C Join_Causing
#   U Non_Joining
#   T Transparent
#       See the Arabic block description for more information on these types.
# Field 3: defines the joining group (property name: Joining_Group)
#
# The values of the joining group are based schematically on character
# names. Where a schematic character name consists of two or more parts separated
# by spaces, the formal Joining_Group property value, as specified in
# PropertyValueAliases.txt, consists of the same name parts joined by
# underscores. Hence, the entry:
#
#   0629; TEH MARBUTA; R; TEH MARBUTA
#
# corresponds to [Joining_Group = Teh_Marbuta].
#
# Note: For historical reasons, the property value [Joining_Group = Hamza_On_Heh_Goal]
#   is anachronistically named. It used to apply to both of the following characters
#   in earlier versions of the standard:
#
#   U+06C2 ARABIC LETTER HEH GOAL WITH HAMZA ABOVE
#   U+06C3 ARABIC LETTER TEH MARBUTA GOAL
#
#   However, it currently applies only to U+06C3, and *not* to U+06C2.
#   To avoid destabilizing existing Joining_Group property aliases, the
#   value Hamza_On_Heh_Goal has not been changed, despite the fact that it
#   no longer applies to Hamza On Heh Goal, but only to Teh Marbuta Goal.
#
# Note: Code points that are not explicitly listed in this file are
# either of joining type T or U:
#
# - Those that not explicitly listed that are of General Category Mn, Me, or Cf
#   have joining type T.
# - All others not explicitly listed have type U.
#
# For an explicit listing of characters of joining type T, see
# the derived property file DerivedJoiningType.txt.
#
# There are currently no characters of type L defined in Unicode.
