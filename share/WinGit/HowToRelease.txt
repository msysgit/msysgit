How to create a Windows Release
===============================

A setup executable is named as follows

 - it starts with Git;
 - followed by the official git version if the release is closely
   related to a specific version of official git;
 - followed by
    * preview<date>, for snapshot builds.
    * winrc#, if we reach a certain quality level and plan to release
      a stable version.  If no bugs are found, this can be upgraded
      to a stable release.  We use winrc instead of simply rc to avoid
      confusion with official release candidates.  The prefix "win"
      clearly indicates that the tag is about the Windows release.

Examples:

Git-preview20080313.exe
Git-1.5.4-preview20071014.exe
Git-1.5.4-winrc3.exe
Git-1.5.4.exe

We'll not necessary release a stable version for each official
version. If we merge changes from git.git we will adjust the number.
We will continue releasing previews until we have reached sufficient
stability.

The following is missing before we release a stable installer.

    * features equivalent to official git-#-#-# available in Git Bash.
    * good support for case insensitive filesystems.

We will *not* wait for

    * server functionality (git-daemon, git-shell, ...).
    * git-cheetah.

An msysgit release is tagged by a tag having a postfix '.msysgit.[0-9]+'.

Here is a step-by-step instruction for the maintainer:

   cd /git
   git fetch mingw
   git fetch junio
   git checkout master
   git merge mingw/master
   git merge junio/master
   make -k test | tee test.log
   # check test.log

   make clean
   git tag -a v<version>.msysgit.<number>
   make install

   cd /doc/git/html
   git fetch
   git checkout master
   git merge origin/master

   cd /share/WinGit
   git checkout master
   start ReleaseNotes.rtf # edit and save
   git commit -a
   git tag -a -m "Git-<version>" Git-<version>
   ./release.sh <version>

   # Test installer.

   # Upload to Google code (verify sha1).

   cd /git
   git push master
   git push <version>-msysgit<number>
   cd /
   git push master
   git push Git-<version>
   # Don't forget to push tags.

   # Reply to Junio's announcement.
   # Start the subject of your email with '[ANNOUNCE]'.
