Look for files starting with RelNotes.


Known issues
------------

   * If ssh-agent is running uninstall fails to remove all
     files and reinstalling fails because it cannot write to
     ssh-agent.exe. Killing all ssh-agent processes solves
     the issue.

   * pull/fetch in git-gui fails. Use Git Bash to avoid the
     problem.

   * If you installed with option "Git and included Unix tools"
     and later install with a different option without uninstalling
     before, HOME will still be set. Uninstall before installing
     to avoid this problem.
