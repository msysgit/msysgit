Version 5.002
-------------

The main enhancement to the Perl core was the addition of prototypes.
Many of the modules that come with Perl have been extensively upgraded.

Other than that, nearly all the changes for 5.002 were bug fixes of one
variety or another, so here's the bug list, along with the "resolution"
for each of them.  If you wish to correspond about any of them, please
include the bug number (if any).

Changes specific to the Configure and build process are described
at the bottom.

Added APPLLIB_EXP for embedded perl library support.
Files patched: perl.c

Couldn't define autoloaded routine by assignment to typeglob.
Files patched: pp_hot.c sv.c

NETaa13525: Tiny patch to fix installman -n
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: installman

NETaa13525: de-documented \v
Files patched: pod/perlop.pod pod/perlre.pod

NETaa13525: doc changes
Files patched: pod/perlop.pod pod/perltrap.pod

NETaa13525: perlxs update from Dean Roehrich
Files patched: pod/perlxs.pod

NETaa13525: rename powerunix to powerux
Files patched: MANIFEST hints/powerux.sh

NETaa13540: VMS uses CLK_TCK for HZ
Files patched: pp_sys.c

NETaa13721: pad_findlex core dumps on bad CvOUTSIDE()
From: Carl Witty
Files patched: op.c sv.c toke.c
 Each CV has a reference to the CV containing it lexically.  Unfortunately,
 it didn't reference-count this reference, so when the outer CV was freed,
 we ended up with a pointer to memory that got reused later as some other kind
 of SV.

NETaa13721: warning suppression
Files patched: toke.c
 (same)

NETaa13722: walk.c had inconsistent static declarations
From: Tim Bunce
Files patched: x2p/walk.c
 Consolidated the various declarations and made them consistent with
 the actual definitions.

NETaa13724: -MPackage=args patch
From: Tim Bunce
Files patched: perl.c pod/perlrun.pod
 Added in the -MPackage=args patch too.

NETaa13729: order-of-evaluation dependency in scope.c on leaving REGCONTEXT
From: "Jason Shirk"
Files patched: scope.c
 Did
 
                 I32 delta = SSPOPINT;
                 savestack_ix -= delta;  /* regexp must have croaked */
 
 instead.

NETaa13731: couldn't assign external lexical array to itself
From: oneill@cs.sfu.ca
Files patched: op.c
 The pad_findmy routine was only checking previous statements for previous
 mention of external lexicals, so the fact that the current statement
 already mentioned @list was not noted.  It therefore allocated another
 reference to the outside lexical, and this didn't compare equal when
 the assigment parsing code was trying to determine whether there was a
 common variable on either side of the equals.  Since it didn't see the
 same variable, it thought it could avoid making copies of the values on
 the stack during list assignment.  Unfortunately, before using those
 values, the list assignment has to zero out the target array, which
 destroys the values.
 
 The fix was to make pad_findmy search the current statement as well.  This
 was actually a holdover from some old code that was trying to delay
 introduction of "my" variables until the next statement.  This is now
 done with a different mechanism, so the fix should not adversely affect
 that.

NETaa13733: s/// doesn't free old string when using copy mode
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: pp_ctl.c pp_hot.c
 When I removed the use of sv_replace(), I simply forgot to free the old char*.

NETaa13736: closures leaked memory
From: Carl Witty
Files patched: op.c pp.c
 This is a specific example of a more general bug, fixed as NETaa13760, having
 to do with reference counts on comppads.

NETaa13739: XSUB interface caches gimme in case XSUB clobbers it
From: Dean Roehrich
Files patched: pp_hot.c
 Applied suggest patch.  Also deleted second gimme declaration as redundant.

NETaa13760: comppad reference counts were inconsistent
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: op.c perl.c pp_ctl.c toke.c
 All official references to comppads are supposed to be through compcv now,
 but the transformation was not complete, resulting in memory leakage.

NETaa13761: sv_2pv() wrongly preferred IV to NV when SV was readonly
From: "Jack R. Lawler"
Files patched: sv.c
 Okay, I understand how this one happened.  This is a case where a
 beneficial fix uncovered a bug elsewhere.  I changed the constant
 folder to prefer integer results over double if the numbers are the
 same.  In this case, they aren't, but it leaves the integer value there
 anyway because the storage is already allocated for it, and it *might*
 be used in an integer context.  And since it's producing a constant, it
 sets READONLY.  Unfortunately, sv_2pv() bogusly preferred the integer
 value to the double when READONLY was set.  This never showed up if you
 just said
 
     print 1.4142135623731;
 
 because in that case, there was already a string value.
 

NETaa13772: shmwrite core dumps consistently
From: Gabe Schaffer
Files patched: opcode.h opcode.pl
 The shmwrite operator is a list operator but neglected to push a stack
 mark beforehand, because an 'm' was missing from opcode.pl.

NETaa13773: $. was misdocumented as read-only.
From: Inaba Hiroto
Files patched: pod/perlvar.pod
     <1.array-element-read-only>
     % perl -le '$,=", "; $#w=5; for (@w) { $_=1; } print @w' 
     Modification of a read-only value attempted at -e line 1.
     % perl4 -le '$,=", "; $#w=5; for (@w) { $_=1; } print @w'   
     1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
 
 This one may stay the way it is for performance reasons.
 
     <2.begin-local-RS>
     % cat abc
     a
     b
     c
     % perl -e 'BEGIN { local $/ = ""; } print "$.:$_" while <>;' abc
     1:a
     b
     c
     % perl -e '{ local $/ = ""; } print "$.:$_" while <>;' abc
     1:a
     2:b
     3:c
 
 $/ wasn't initialized early enough, so local set it back to permanently
 undefined on exit from the block.
 
     <3.grep-x0-bug>
     % perl -le 'print grep(/^-/ ? ($x=$_) x 0 : 1, "a", "-b", "c");'
     a
 
     % perl4 -le 'print grep(/^-/ ? ($x=$_) x 0 : 1, "a", "-b", "c");'
     ac
 
 An extra mark was left on the stack if (('x') x $repeat) was used in a scalar
 context.
 
     <4.input-lineno-assign>
     # perl -w does not complain about assignment to $. (Is this just a feature?)
     # perlvar.pod says "This variable should be considered read-only."
     % cat abc
     a
     b
     c
     % perl -wnle '$. = 10 if $. == 2; print "$.:$_"' abc
     1:a
     10:b
     11:c
 
 Fixed doc.
 
     <5.local-soft-ref.bug>
     % perl -e 'local ${"a"}=1;'
     zsh: 529 segmentation fault  perl -e 'local ${"a"}=1;'
 
 Now says
     Can't localize a reference at -e line 1.
 
     <6.package-readline>
     % perl -e 'package foo; sub foo { 1; } package main; $_ = foo::foo(); print'
     1
     % perl -e '
       package readline; sub foo { 1; } package main; $_ = readline::foo(); print'
     Undefined subroutine &main::foo called at -e line 1.
     % perl -e '
       package readline; sub foo { 1; } package main; $_ = &readline::foo(); print'
     1
 
 Now treats foo::bar correctly even if foo is a keyword.
 
     <7.page-head-set-to-null-string>
     % cat page-head
     #From: russell@ccu1.auckland.ac.nz (Russell Fulton)
     #Newsgroups: comp.lang.perl
     #Subject: This script causes Perl 5.00 to sementation fault
     #Date: 15 Nov 1994 00:11:37 GMT

     select((select(STDOUT),  $^='')[0]);  #this is the critical line
     $a = 'a';
     write ;
     exit;
 
     format STDOUT =
     @<<<<<<
     $a
     .
 
     % perl page-head
     zsh: 1799 segmentation fault  perl /tmp/page-head
 
 Now says
     Undefined top format "main::" called at ./try line 11.
 
     <8.sub-as-index>
     # parser bug?
     % perl -le 'sub foo {0}; $x[0]=0;$x[foo]<=0'
     Unterminated <> operator at -e line 1.
     % perl -le 'sub foo {0}; $x[0]=0;$x[foo()]<=0'
 
 A right square bracket now forces expectation of an operator.
 
     <9.unary-minus-to-regexp-var>
     % cat minus-reg
     #From: Michael Cook <mcook@cognex.com>
     #Newsgroups: comp.lang.perl

     print $&, "\n";
     print -$&, "\n";
     print 0-$&, "\n";
 
     % perl minus-reg
     123
     123
     -123
 
 Apparently already fixed in my copy.
 
     <10.vec-segv>
     % cat vec-bug
     ## Offset values are changed for my machine.
 
     #From: augustin@gdstech.grumman.com (Conrad Augustin)

     #The following two statements each produce a segmentation fault in perl5:

     % perl vec-bug
     zsh: 1806 segmentation fault  perl vec-bug

NETaa13773: $/ not correctly localized in BEGIN
Files patched: perl.c
 (same)

NETaa13773: foo::bar was misparsed if foo was a reserved word
Files patched: toke.c toke.c
 (same)

NETaa13773: right square bracket didn't force expectation of operator
Files patched: toke.c
 (same)

NETaa13773: scalar ((x) x $repeat) left stack mark
Files patched: op.c
 (same)

NETaa13778: -w coredumps on <$>
From: Hans Mulder
Files patched: pp_hot.c toke.c
 Now produces suggested error message.  Also installed guard in warning code
 that coredumped.

NETaa13779: foreach didn't use savestack mechanism
From: Hans Mulder
Files patched: cop.h pp_ctl.c
 The foreach mechanism saved the old scalar value on the context stack
 rather than the savestack.  It could consequently get out of sync if
 unexpectedly unwound.

NETaa13785: GIMME sometimes used wrong context frame
From: Greg Earle
Files patched: embed.h global.sym op.h pp_ctl.c proto.h
 The expression inside the return was taking its context from the immediately
 surrounding block rather than the innermost surrounding subroutine call.

NETaa13797: could modify sv_undef through auto-vivification
From: Ilya Zakharevich
Files patched: pp.c
 Inserted the missing check for readonly values on auto-vivification.

NETaa13798: if (...) {print} treats print as quoted
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: toke.c
 The trailing paren of the condition was setting expectations to XOPERATOR
 rather than XBLOCK, so it was being treated like ${print}.

NETaa13926: commonality was not detected in assignments using COND_EXPR
From: Mark Hanson
Files patched: opcode.h opcode.pl
 The assignment compiler didn't check the 2nd and 3rd args of a ?:
 for commonality.  It still doesn't, but I made ?: into a "dangerous"
 operator so it is forced to treat it as common.

NETaa13957: was marking the PUSHMARK as modifiable rather than the arg
From: David Couture
Files patched: op.c sv.c
 It was marking the PUSHMARK as modifiable rather than the arg.

NETaa13962: documentation of behavior of scalar <*> was unclear
From: Tom Christiansen
Files patched: pod/perlop.pod
 Added the following to perlop:
 
 A glob only evaluates its (embedded) argument when it is starting a new
 list.  All values must be read before it will start over.  In a list
 context this isn't important, because you automatically get them all
 anyway.  In a scalar context, however, the operator returns the next value
 each time it is called, or a FALSE value if you've just run out.  Again,
 FALSE is returned only once.  So if you're expecting a single value from
 a glob, it is much better to say
 
     ($file) = <blurch*>;
 
 than
 
     $file = <blurch*>;
 
 because the latter will alternate between returning a filename and
 returning FALSE.
 

NETaa13986: split ignored /m pattern modifier
From: Winfried Koenig
Files patched: pp.c
 Fixed to work like m// and s///.

NETaa13992: regexp comments not seen after + in non-extended regexp
From: Mark Knutsen
Files patched: regcomp.c
 The code to skip regexp comments was guarded by a conditional that only
 let it work when /x was in effect.

NETaa14014: use subs should not count as definition, only as declaration
From: Keith Thompson
Files patched: sv.c
 On *foo = \&bar, doesn't set GVf_IMPORTED if foo and bar are in same package.

NETaa14021: sv_inc and sv_dec "upgraded" magical SV to non-magical
From: Paul A Sand
Also: Andreas Koenig
Files patched: sv.c
 The sv_inc() and sv_dec() routines "upgraded" null magical SVs to non-magical.

NETaa14086: require should check tainting
From: Karl Simon Berg
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 Since we shouldn't allow tainted requires anyway, it now says:
 
   Insecure dependency in require while running with -T switch at tst.pl line 1.

NETaa14104: negation fails on magical variables like $1
From: tim
Files patched: pp.c
 Negation was failing on magical values like $1.  It was testing the wrong
 bits and also failed to provide a final "else" if none of the bits matched.

NETaa14107: deep sort return leaked contexts
From: Quentin Fennessy
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 Needed to call dounwind() appropriately.

NETaa14129: attempt to localize via a reference core dumps
From: Michele Sardo
Files patched: op.c pod/perldiag.pod
 Now produces an error "Can't localize a reference", with explanation in
 perldiag.

NETaa14138: substr() and s/// can cause core dump
From: Andrew Vignaux
Files patched: pp_hot.c
 Forgot to call SvOOK_off() on the SV before freeing its string.

NETaa14145: ${@INC}[0] dumped core in debugger
From: Hans Mulder
Files patched: sv.c
 Now croaks "Bizarre copy of ARRAY in block exit", which is better than
 a core dump.  The fact that ${@INC}[0] means $INC[0] outside the debugger
 is a different bug.

NETaa14147: bitwise assignment ops wipe out byte of target string
From: Jim Richardson
Files patched: doop.c
 The code was assuming that the target was not either of the two operands,
 which is false for an assignment operator.

NETaa14153: lexing of lexicals in patterns fooled by character class
From: Dave Bianchi
Files patched: toke.c
 It never called the dwimmer, which is how it fooled it.

NETaa14154: allowed autoloaded methods by recognizing sub method; declaration
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: gv.c
 Made sub method declaration sufficient for autoloader to stop searching on.

NETaa14156: shouldn't optimize block scope on tainting
From: Pete Peterson
Files patched: op.c toke.c
 I totally disabled the block scope optimization when running tainted.

NETaa14157: -T and -B only allowed 1/30 "odd" characters--changed to 1/3
From: Tor Lillqvist
Files patched: pp_sys.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14160: deref of null symbol should produce null list
From: Jared Rhine
Files patched: pp_hot.c
 It didn't check for list context before returning undef.

NETaa14162: POSIX::gensym now returns a symbol reference
From: Josh N. Pritikin
Also: Tim Bunce
Files patched: ext/POSIX/POSIX.pm
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14164: POSIX autoloader now distinguishes non-constant "constants"
From: Tim Bunce <Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk>
Files patched: ext/POSIX/POSIX.pm ext/POSIX/POSIX.xs
 The .xs file now distinguishes non-constant "constants" by setting EAGAIN.
 This will also let us use #ifdef within the .xs file to de-constantify
 any other macros that happen not to be constants even if they don't use
 an argument.

NETaa14166: missing semicolon after "my" induces core dump
From: Thomas Kofler
Files patched: toke.c
 The parser was left thinking it was still processing a "my", and flubbed.
 I made it wipe out the "in_my" variable on a syntax error.

NETaa14166: missing semicolon after "my" induces core dump"
Files patched: toke.c
 (same)

NETaa14206: can now use English and strict at the same time
From: Andrew Wilcox
Files patched: sv.c
 It now counts imported symbols as okay under "use strict".

NETaa14206: can now use English and strict at the same time 
Files patched: gv.c pod/perldiag.pod
 (same)

NETaa14265: elseif now produces severe warning
From: Yutao Feng
Files patched: pod/perldiag.pod toke.c
 Now complains explicitly about "elseif".

NETaa14279: list assignment propagated taintedness to independent scalars
From: Tim Freeman
Files patched: pp_hot.c
 List assignment needed to be modified so that tainting didn't propagate
 between independent scalar values.

NETaa14312: undef in @EXPORTS core dumps
From: William Setzer
Files patched: lib/Exporter.pm
 Now says:
 
     Unable to create sub named "t::" at lib/Exporter.pm line 159.
     Illegal null symbol in @t::EXPORT at -e line 1
     BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at -e line 1.
 

NETaa14312: undef in @EXPORTS core dumps     
Files patched: pod/perldiag.pod sv.c
 (same)

NETaa14321: literal @array check shouldn't happen inside embedded expressions
From: Mark H. Nodine
Files patched: toke.c
 The general solution to this is to disable the literal @array check within
 any embedded expression.  For instance, this also failed bogusly:
 
     print "$foo{@foo}";
 
 The reason fixing this also fixes the s///e problem is that the lexer
 effectively puts the RHS into a do {} block, making the expression
 embedded within curlies, as far as the error message is concerned.

NETaa14322: now localizes $! during POSIX::AUTOLOAD
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: ext/POSIX/POSIX.pm
 Added local $! = 0.

NETaa14324: defined() causes spurious sub existence
From: "Andreas Koenig"
Files patched: op.c pp.c
 It called pp_rv2cv which wrongly assumed it could add any sub it referenced.

NETaa14336: use Module () forces import of nothing
From: Tim Bunce
Files patched: op.c
 use Module () now refrains from calling import at all.

NETaa14353: added special HE allocator
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: global.sym

NETaa14353: added special HE allocator 
Files patched: hv.c perl.h

NETaa14353: array extension now converts old memory to SV storage.
Files patched: av.c av.h sv.c

NETaa14353: hashes now convert old storage into SV arenas.
Files patched: global.sym

NETaa14353: hashes now convert old storage into SV arenas.  
Files patched: hv.c perl.h

NETaa14353: upgraded SV arena allocation

 Subject: Re: Jumbo Configure patch vs. 1m. 
 Date: Thu, 28 Sep 95 17:18:54 -0700
 From: lwall@scalpel.netlabs.com (Larry Wall)
 
 : No.  Larry's currently got the patch pumpkin for all such core perl topics.
 
 I dunno whether you should let me have the patch pumpkin or not.  To fix
 a Sev 2 I just hacked in rudimentary prototypes.  :-)
 
 We can now define true unary subroutines, as well as argumentless
 subroutines:
 
     sub baz () { 12; }			# Must not have argument
     sub bar ($) { $_[0] * 7 }		# Must have exactly one argument
     sub foo ($@) { print "@_\n" }	# Must have at least one argument
     foo bar baz / 2 || "oops", "is the answer";
 
 This prints "42 is the answer" on my machine.  That is, it's the same as
 
     foo( bar( baz() / 2) || "oops", "is the answer");
 
 Attempting to compile
 
     foo;
 
 results in
 
     Too few arguments for main::foo at ./try line 8, near "foo;"
 
 Compiling
 
     bar 1,2,3;
 
 results in
 
     Too many arguments for main::bar at ./try line 8, near "foo;"
     
 But
 
     @array = ('a','b','c');
     foo @array, @array;
     
 prints "3 a b c" because the $ puts the first arg of foo into scalar context.
 
 The main win at this point is that we can say
 
     sub AAA () { 1; }
     sub BBB () { 2; }
 
 and the user can say AAA + BBB and get 3.
 
 I'm not quite sure how this interacts with autoloading though.  I fear
 POSIX.pm will need to say
 
     sub E2BIG ();
     sub EACCES ();
     sub EAGAIN ();
     sub EBADF ();
     sub EBUSY ();
     ...
     sub _SC_STREAM_MAX ();
     sub _SC_TZNAME_MAX ();
     sub _SC_VERSION ();
 
 unless we can figure out how to efficiently declare a default prototype
 at import time.  Meaning, not using eval.  Currently
 
     *foo = \&bar;
 
 (the ordinary import mechanism) implicitly stubs &bar with no prototype if
 &bar is not yet declared.  It's almost like you want an AUTOPROTO to
 go with your AUTOLOAD.
 
 Another thing to rub one's 5 o'clock shadow over is that there's no way
 to apply a prototype to a method call at compile time.
 
 And no, I don't want to have the
 
     sub howabout ($formal, @arguments) { ... }
 
 argument right now.

NETaa14422: couldn't take reference of a prototyped function
Files patched: op.c
 (same)

NETaa14423: use didn't allow expressions involving the scratch pad
From: Graham Barr
Files patched: op.c perly.c perly.c.diff perly.y proto.h vms/perly_c.vms
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14444: lexical scalar didn't autovivify
From: Gurusamy Sarathy
Files patched: op.c pp_hot.c
 It didn't have code in pp_padsv to do the right thing.

NETaa14448: caller could dump core when used within an eval or require
From: Danny R. Faught
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 caller() was incorrectly assuming the context stack contained a subroutine
 context when it in fact contained an eval context.

NETaa14451: improved error message on bad pipe filehandle
From: Danny R. Faught
Files patched: pp_sys.c
 Now says the slightly more informative
 
     Can't use an undefined value as filehandle reference at ./try line 3.

NETaa14462: pp_dbstate had a scope leakage on recursion suppression
From: Tim Bunce
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 Swapped the code in question around.

NETaa14482: sv_unref freed ref prematurely at times
From: Gurusamy Sarathy
Files patched: sv.c
 Made sv_unref() mortalize rather than free the old reference.

NETaa14484: appending string to array produced bizarre results
From: Greg Ward
Also: Malcolm Beattie
Files patched: pp_hot.c
 Will now say, "Can't coerce ARRAY to string".

NETaa14525: assignment to globs didn't reset them correctly
From: Gurusamy Sarathy
Files patched: sv.c
 Applied parts of patch not overridden by subsequent patch.

NETaa14529: a partially matching subpattern could spoof infinity detector
From: Wayne Berke
Files patched: regexec.c
 A partial match on a subpattern could fool the infinite regress detector
 into thinking progress had been made.
 The previous workaround prevented another bug (NETaa14529) from being fixed,
 so I've backed it out.  I'll need to think more about how to detect failure
 to progress.  I'm still hopeful it's not equivalent to the halting problem.

NETaa14535: patches from Gurusamy Sarathy
From: Gurusamy Sarathy
Files patched: op.c pp.c pp_hot.c regexec.c sv.c toke.c
 Applied most recent suggested patches.

NETaa14537: select() can return too soon
From: Matt Kimball

NETaa14538: method calls were treated like do {} under loop modifiers
From: Ilya Zakharevich
Files patched: perly.c perly.y
 Needed to take the OPf_SPECIAL flag off of entersubs from method reductions.
 (It was probably a cut-and-paste error from long ago.)

NETaa14540: foreach (@array) no longer does extra stack copy
From: darrinm@lmc.com
Files patched: Todo op.c pp_ctl.c pp_hot.c
 Fixed by doing the foreach(@array) optimization, so it iterates
 directly through the array, and can detect the implicit shift from
 referencing <>.

NETaa14541: new version of perlbug
From: Kenneth Albanowski
Files patched: README pod/perl.pod utils/perlbug.PL
 Brought it up to version 1.09.

NETaa14541: perlbug 1.11
Files patched: utils/perlbug.PL
 (same)

NETaa14548: magic sets didn't check private OK bits
From: W. Bradley Rubenstein
Files patched: mg.c
 The magic code was getting mixed up between private and public POK bits.

NETaa14550: made ~ magic magical
From: Tim Bunce
Files patched: sv.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14551: humongous header causes infinite loop in format
From: Grace Lee
Files patched: pp_sys.c
 Needed to check for page exhaustion after doing top-of-form.

NETaa14558: attempt to call undefined top format core dumped
From: Hallvard B Furuseth
Files patched: pod/perldiag.pod pp_sys.c
 Now issues an error on attempts to call a non-existent top format.

NETaa14561: Gurusamy Sarathy's G_KEEPERR patch
From: Andreas Koenig
Also: Gurusamy Sarathy
Also: Tim Bunce
Files patched: cop.h interp.sym perl.c perl.h pp_ctl.c pp_sys.c sv.c toke.c
 Applied latest patch.

NETaa14581: shouldn't execute BEGIN when there are compilation errors
From: Rickard Westman
Files patched: op.c
 Perl should not try to execute BEGIN and END blocks if there's been a
 compilation error.

NETaa14582: got SEGV sorting sparse array
From: Rick Pluta
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 Now weeds out undefined values much like Perl 4 did.
 Now sorts undefined values to the front.

NETaa14582: sort was letting unsortable values through to comparison routine
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 (same)

NETaa14585: globs in pad space weren't properly cleaned up
From: Gurusamy Sarathy
Files patched: op.c pp.c pp_hot.c sv.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14614: now does dbmopen with perl_eval_sv()
From: The Man
Files patched: perl.c pp_sys.c proto.h
 dbmopen now invokes perl_eval_sv(), which should handle error conditions
 better.

NETaa14618: exists doesn't work in GDBM_File
From: Andrew Wilcox
Files patched: ext/GDBM_File/GDBM_File.xs
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14619: tied()
From: Larry Wall
Also: Paul Marquess
Files patched: embed.h global.sym keywords.h keywords.pl opcode.h opcode.pl pp_sys.c toke.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14636: Jumbo Dynaloader patch
From: Tim Bunce
Files patched: ext/DynaLoader/DynaLoader.pm ext/DynaLoader/dl_dld.xs ext/DynaLoader/dl_dlopen.xs ext/DynaLoader/dl_hpux.xs ext/DynaLoader/dl_next.xs ext/DynaLoader/dl_vms.xs ext/DynaLoader/dlutils.c
 Applied suggested patches.

NETaa14637: checkcomma routine was stupid about bareword sub calls
From: Tim Bunce <Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk>
Files patched: toke.c
 The checkcomma routine was stupid about bareword sub calls.

NETaa14639: (?i) didn't reset on runtime patterns
From: Mark A. Scheel
Files patched: op.h pp_ctl.c toke.c
 It didn't distinguish between permanent flags outside the pattern and
 temporary flags within the pattern.

NETaa14649: selecting anonymous globs dumps core
From: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: cop.h doio.c embed.h global.sym perl.c pp_sys.c proto.h
 Applied suggested patch, but reversed the increment and decrement to avoid
 decrementing and freeing what we're going to increment.

NETaa14655: $? returned negative value on AIX
From: Kim Frutiger
Also: Stephen D. Lee
Files patched: pp_sys.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14668: {2,} could match once
From: Hugo van der Sanden
Files patched: regexec.c
 When an internal pattern failed a conjecture, it didn't back off on the
 number of times it thought it had matched.

NETaa14673: open $undefined dumped core
From: Samuli K{rkk{inen
Files patched: pp_sys.c
 pp_open() didn't check its argument for globness.

NETaa14683: stringifies were running pad out of space
From: Robin Barker
Files patched: op.h toke.c
 Increased PADOFFSET to a U32, and made lexer not put double-quoted strings
 inside OP_STRINGIFY unless they really needed it.

NETaa14689: shouldn't have . in @INC when tainting
From: William R. Somsky
Files patched: perl.c
 Now does not put . into @INC when tainting.  It may still be added with a 
 
     use lib ".";
 
 or, to put it at the end,
 
     BEGIN { push(@INC, ".") }
 
 but this is not recommended unless a chdir to a known location has been done
 first.

NETaa14690: values inside tainted SVs were ignored
From: "James M. Stern"
Files patched: pp.c pp_ctl.c
 It was assuming that a tainted value was a string.

NETaa14692: format name required qualification under use strict
From: Tom Christiansen
Files patched: gv.c
 Now treats format names the same as subroutine names.

NETaa14695: added simple regexp caching
From: John Rowe
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14697: regexp comments were sometimes wrongly treated as literal text
From: Tom Christiansen
Files patched: regcomp.c
 The literal-character grabber didn't know about extended comments.
 N.B. '#' is treated as a comment character whenever the /x option is
 used now, so you can't include '#' as a simple literal in /x regexps.
 
 (By the way, Tom, the boxed form of quoting in the previous enclosure is
 exceeding antisocial when you want to extract the code from it.)

NETaa14704: closure got wrong outer scope if outer sub was predeclared
From: Marc Paquette
Files patched: op.c
 The outer scope of the anonymous sub was set to the stub rather than to
 the actual subroutine.  I kludged it by making the outer scope of the
 stub be the actual subroutine, if anything is depending on the stub.

NETaa14705: $foo .= $foo did free memory read
From: Gerd Knops
Files patched: sv.c
 Now modifies address to copy if it was reallocated.

NETaa14709: Chip's FileHandle stuff
From: Larry Wall
Also: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: MANIFEST ext/FileHandle/FileHandle.pm ext/FileHandle/FileHandle.xs ext/FileHandle/Makefile.PL ext/POSIX/POSIX.pm ext/POSIX/POSIX.pod ext/POSIX/POSIX.xs lib/FileCache.pm lib/Symbol.pm t/lib/filehand.t t/lib/posix.t
 Applied suggested patches.

NETaa14711: added (&) and (*) prototypes for blocks and symbols
From: Kenneth Albanowski
Files patched: Makefile.SH op.c perly.c perly.h perly.y toke.c
 & now means that it must have an anonymous sub as that argument.  If
 it's the first argument, the sub may be specified as a block in the
 indirect object slot, much like grep or sort, which have prototypes of (&@).
 
 Also added * so you can do things like
 
     sub myopen (*;$);
 
     myopen(FOO, $filename);

NETaa14713: setuid FROM root now defaults to not do tainting
From: Tony Camas
Files patched: mg.c perl.c pp_hot.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14714: duplicate magics could be added to an SV
From: Yary Hluchan
Files patched: sv.c sv.c
 The sv_magic() routine didn't properly check to see if it already had a
 magic of that type.  Ordinarily it would have, but it was called during
 mg_get(), which forces the magic flags off temporarily.

NETaa14721: sub defined during erroneous do-FILE caused core dump
From: David Campbell
Files patched: op.c
 Fixed the seg fault.  I couldn't reproduce the return problem.

NETaa14734: ref should never return undef
From: Dale Amon
Files patched: pp.c t/op/overload.t
 Now returns null string.

NETaa14751: slice of undefs now returns null list
From: Tim Bunce
Files patched: pp.c pp_hot.c
 Null list clobberation is now done in lslice, not aassign.

NETaa14789: select coredumped on Linux
From: Ulrich Kunitz
Files patched: pp_sys.c
 Applied suggested patches, more or less.

NETaa14789: straightened out ins and out of duping
Files patched: lib/IPC/Open3.pm
 (same)

NETaa14791: implemented internal SUPER class
From: Nick Ing-Simmons
Also: Dean Roehrich
Files patched: gv.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14845: s/// didn't handle offset strings
From: Ken MacLeod
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 Needed a call to SvOOK_off(targ) in pp_substcont().

NETaa14851: Use of << to mean <<"" is deprecated
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: toke.c

NETaa14865: added HINT_BLOCK_SCOPE to "elsif"
From: Jim Avera
Files patched: perly.y
 Needed to set HINT_BLOCK_SCOPE on "elsif" to prevent the do block from
 being optimized away, which caused the statement transition in elsif
 to reset the stack too far back.

NETaa14876: couldn't delete localized GV safely
From: John Hughes
Files patched: pp.c scope.c
 The reference count of the "borrowed" GV needed to be incremented while
 there was a reference to it in the savestack.

NETaa14887: couldn't negate magical scalars
From: ian
Also: Gurusamy Sarathy
Files patched: pp.c
 Applied suggested patch, more or less.  (It's not necessary to test both
 SvNIOK and SvNIOKp, since the private bits are always set if the public
 bits are set.)

NETaa14893: /m modifier was sticky
From: Jim Avera
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 pp_match() and pp_subst() were using an improperly scoped SAVEINT to restore
 the value of the internal variable multiline.

NETaa14893: /m modifier was sticky     
Files patched: cop.h pp_hot.c
 (same)

NETaa14916: complete.pl retained old return value
From: Martyn Pearce
Files patched: lib/complete.pl
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14928: non-const 3rd arg to split assigned to list could coredump
From: Hans de Graaff
Files patched: op.c
 The optimizer was assuming the OP was an OP_CONST.

NETaa14942: substr as lvalue could disable magic
From: Darrell Kindred <dkindred+@cmu.edu>
Files patched: pp.c
 The substr was disabling the magic of $1.

NETaa14990: "not" not parseable when expecting term
From: "Randal L. Schwartz"
Files patched: perly.c perly.c.diff perly.y vms/perly_c.vms
 The NOTOP production needed to be moved down into the terms.

NETaa14993: Bizarre copy of formline
From: Tom Christiansen
Also: Charles Bailey
Files patched: sv.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa14998: sv_add_arena() no longer leaks memory
From: Andreas Koenig
Files patched: av.c hv.c perl.h sv.c
 Now keeps one potential arena "on tap", but doesn't use it unless there's
 demand for SV headers.  When an AV or HV is extended, its old memory
 becomes the next potential arena unless there already is one, in which
 case it is simply freed.  This will have the desired property of not
 stranding medium-sized chunks of memory when extending a single array
 repeatedly, but will not degrade when there's no SV demand beyond keeping
 one chunk of memory on tap, which generally will be about 250 bytes big,
 since it prefers the earlier freed chunk over the later.  See the nice_chunk
 variable.

NETaa14999: $a and $b now protected from use strict and lexical declaration
From: Tom Christiansen
Files patched: gv.c pod/perldiag.pod toke.c
 Bare $a and $b are now allowed during "use strict".  In addition,
 the following diag was added:
 
 =item Can't use "my %s" in sort comparison
 
 (F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
 You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the <=> or cmp operator,
 and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
 Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
 lexical variable.
 

NETaa15034: use strict refs should allow calls to prototyped functions
From: Roderick Schertler
Files patched: perly.c perly.c.diff perly.y toke.c vms/perly_c.vms
 Applied patch suggested by Chip.

NETaa15083: forced $AUTOLOAD to be untainted
From: Tim Bunce
Files patched: gv.c pp_hot.c
 Stripped any taintmagic from $AUTOLOAD after setting it.

NETaa15084: patch for Term::Cap
From: Mark Kaehny
Also: Hugo van der Sanden
Files patched: lib/Term/Cap.pm
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15086: null pattern could cause coredump in s//_$1_/
From: "Paul E. Maisano"
Files patched: cop.h pp_ctl.c
 If the replacement pattern was complicated enough to cause pp_substcont
 to be called, then it lost track of which REGEXP* it was supposed to
 be using.

NETaa15087: t/io/pipe.t didn't work on AIX
From: Andy Dougherty
Files patched: t/io/pipe.t
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15088: study was busted
From: Hugo van der Sanden
Files patched: opcode.h opcode.pl pp.c
 It was studying its scratch pad target rather than the argument supplied.

NETaa15090: MSTATS patch
From: Tim Bunce
Files patched: global.sym malloc.c perl.c perl.h proto.h
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15098: longjmp out of magic leaks memory
From: Chip Salzenberg

 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15102: getpgrp() is broken if getpgrp2() is available
From: Roderick Schertler
Files patched: perl.h pp_sys.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15103: prototypes leaked opcodes
From: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: op.c

NETaa15107: quotameta memory bug on all metacharacters
From: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: pp.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15108: Fix for incomplete string leak
From: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: toke.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15110: couldn't use $/ with 8th bit set on some architectures
From: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: doop.c interp.sym mg.c op.c perl.c perl.h pp_ctl.c pp_hot.c pp_sys.c sv.c toke.c util.c
 Applied suggested patches.

NETaa15112: { a_1 => 2 } didn't parse as expected
From: Stuart M. Weinstein
Files patched: toke.c
 The little dwimmer was only skipping ALPHA rather than ALNUM chars.

NETaa15123: bitwise ops produce spurious warnings
From: Hugo van der Sanden
Also: Chip Salzenberg
Also: Andreas Gustafsson
Files patched: sv.c
 Decided to suppress the warning in the conversion routines if merely converting
 a temporary, which can never be a user-supplied value anyway.

NETaa15129: #if defined (foo) misparsed in h2ph
From: Roderick Schertler <roderick@gate.net>
Files patched: utils/h2ph.PL
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15131: some POSIX functions assumed valid filehandles
From: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: ext/POSIX/POSIX.xs
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15151: don't optimize split on OPpASSIGN_COMMON
From: Huw Rogers
Files patched: op.c
 Had to swap the optimization down to after the assignment op is generated
 and COMMON is calculated, and then clean up the resultant tree differently.

NETaa15154: MakeMaker-5.18
From: Andreas Koenig
Files patched: MANIFEST lib/ExtUtils/Liblist.pm lib/ExtUtils/MM_VMS.pm lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm lib/ExtUtils/Mksymlists.pm
 Brought it up to 5.18.

NETaa15156: some Exporter tweaks
From: Roderick Schertler
Also: Tim Bunce
Files patched: lib/Exporter.pm
 Also did Tim's Tiny Trivial patch.

NETaa15157: new version of Test::Harness
From: Andreas Koenig
Files patched: lib/Test/Harness.pm
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15175: overloaded nomethod has garbage 4th op
From: Ilya Zakharevich
Files patched: gv.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15179: SvPOK_only shouldn't back off on offset pointer
From: Gutorm.Hogasen@oslo.teamco.telenor.no
Files patched: sv.h
 SvPOK_only() was calling SvOOK_off(), which adjusted the string pointer
 after tr/// has already acquired it.  It shouldn't really be necessary
 for SvPOK_only() to undo an offset string pointer, since there's no
 conflict with a possible integer value where the offset is stored.

NETaa15193: & now always bypasses prototype checking
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: dump.c op.c op.h perly.c perly.c.diff perly.y pod/perlsub.pod pp_hot.c proto.h toke.c vms/perly_c.vms vms/perly_h.vms
 Turned out to be a big hairy deal because the lexer turns foo() into &foo().
 But it works consistently now.  Also fixed pod.

NETaa15197: 5.002b2 is 'appending' to $@
From: Gurusamy Sarathy
Files patched: pp_ctl.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15201: working around Linux DBL_DIG problems

NETaa15227: $i < 10000 should optimize to integer op
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: op.c op.c
 The program
 
     for ($i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++) {
 	push @foo, $i;
     }
 
 takes about one quarter the memory if the optimizer decides that it can
 use an integer < comparison rather than floating point.  It now does so
 if one side is an integer constant and the other side a simple variable.
 This should really help some of our benchmarks.  You can still force a
 floating point comparison by using 100000.0 instead.

NETaa15228: CPerl-mode patch
From: Ilya Zakharevich
Files patched: emacs/cperl-mode.el
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15231: Symbol::qualify()
From: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: ext/FileHandle/FileHandle.pm gv.c lib/SelectSaver.pm lib/Symbol.pm pp_hot.c
 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15236: select select broke under use strict
From: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: op.c
 Instead of inventing a new bit, I just turned off the HINT_STRICT_REFS bit.
 I don't think it's worthwhile distinguishing between qualified or unqualified
 names to select.

NETaa15237: use vars
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: MANIFEST gv.c lib/subs.pm lib/vars.pm sv.c

NETaa15240: keep op names _and_ descriptions
From: Chip Salzenberg

NETaa15259: study doesn't unset on string modification
From: Larry Wall
Files patched: mg.c pp.c
 Piggybacked on m//g unset magic to unset the study too.

NETaa15276: pick a better initial cxstack_max
From: Chip Salzenberg
Files patched: perl.c
 Added fudge in, and made it calculate how many it could fit into (most of) 8K,
 to avoid getting 16K of Kingsley malloc.

NETaa15287: numeric comparison optimization adjustments
From: Clark Cooper
Files patched: op.c
 Applied patch suggested by Chip, with liberalization to >= and <=.

NETaa15299: couldn't eval string containing pod or __DATA__     
From: Andreas Koenig
Also: Gisle Aas
Files patched: toke.c
 Basically, eval didn't know how to bypass pods correctly.

NETaa15300: sv_backoff problems

 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15312: Avoid fclose(NULL)

NETaa15331: File::Path::rmtree followed symlinks
From: Andreas Koenig
Files patched: lib/File/Path.pm
 Added suggested patch, except I did
 
        if (not -l $root and -d _) {
 
 for efficiency, since if -d is true, the -l already called lstat on it.

NETaa15339: sv_gets() didn't reset count

 Applied suggested patch.

NETaa15369: change in split optimization broke scalar context
From: Ulrich Pfeifer
Files patched: op.c
 The earlier patch to make the split optimization pay attention to
 OPpASSIGN_COMMON rearranged how the syntax tree is constructed, but kept
 the wrong context flags.  This causes pp_split() do do the wrong thing.

NETaa15423: can't do subversion numbering because of %5.3f assumptions
From: Andy Dougherty
Files patched: configpm patchlevel.h perl.c perl.h pp_ctl.c
 Removed the %5.3f assumptions where appropriate.  patchlevel.h now
 defines SUBVERSION, which if greater than 0 indicates a development version.

NETaa15424: Sigsetjmp patch

----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of user-visible Configure and build changes since 5.001:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Yet more enhancements and fixes have been made to the Configure and
build process for perl.  Most of these will not be visible to the
ordinary user--they just make the process more robust and likely to
work on a wider range of platforms.

This is a brief summary of the most important changes.  A more
detailed description is given below.

    Slightly changed installation directories.  See INSTALL.

    Include 5.000 - 5.001 upgrage notes :-) (see below).  You might
    want to read through them as well as these notes.

    Install documentation for perl modules and pod2* translators.  You can
    now view perl module documentation with either your system's man(1)
    program or with the supplied perldoc script.

    Many hint file updates.

    Improve and simplify detection of local libraries and header files.

    Expand documentation of installation process in new INSTALL file.

    Try to reduce Unixisms (such as SH file extraction) to enhance
    portability to other platforms.  There's still a long way to go.

Upgrade Traps and Pitfalls:

Since a lot has changed in the build process, you are probably best off
starting with a fresh copy of the perl5.002 sources.  In particular,
your 5.000 or 5.001 config.sh will contain several variables that are no
longer needed.  Further, improvements in the Configure tests may mean
that some of the answers will be different than they were in previous
versions, and which answer to keep can be difficult to sort out. 
Therefore, you are probably better off ignoring your old config.sh, as
in the following:

	make -k distclean 	# (if you've built perl before)
	rm -f config.sh 	# (in case distclean mysteriously fails)
	sh Configure [whatever options you like]
	make depend
	make
	make test

This, and much more, is described in the new INSTALL file.

Here are the detailed changes from 5.002beta1 to 5.002b2 in
reverse chronolgical order:

Version 5.002beta2

This is patch.2b2 to perl5.002beta1.  
This takes you from 5.002beta1h to 5.002beta2.

Renaming this as beta2 reflects _my_ feeling that it's time to
wrap up things for the release of 5.002.

Version 5.002b1h
-------------

This is patch.2b1h to perl5.002beta1.  This is mainly a clean-up
patch.  No progress is made dealing with memory leaks or
optimizations, though I have used #define STRANGE_MALLOC to
work around at least some problems.

Index: Configure

    Upgraded to metaconfig patchlevel 60.

    Add in usesafe variable to include or exclude the Safe extension.

    Test for sigaction().

    Check for pager.  This was actually accidental since perldoc.PL
    mentions $pager and metaconfig has a unit to check for the
    user's pager.  In retrospect, I decided the Configure check
    didn't do any harm and some extension writers might decide to
    use it.

    Always put man1dir under $prefix unless a command line
    override is used.

    Allow command-line overrides of $man1ext and $man3ext.


    Allow man1dir and man3dir names like .../man.1 instead of
    just .../man1.

    Lots of rearrangements of various pieces of Configure.
    This might be because I ran metaconfig on a different
    architecture.

    libc searching now honors $libpth.  Previously, it (almost)
    always looked in /usr/lib before checking /lib.

    Only prompt user if voidflags is not 15.  If voidflags is 15, then
    we presume all is well.

    5.002beta1 attempted some memory optimizations, but unfortunately
    they can result in a memory leak problem.  This can be
    avoided by #define STRANGE_MALLOC.  I do that here until
    consensus is reached on a better strategy for handling the
    memory optimizations.

    for the Safe extension).

Index: Configure

    Include Jeff Okamoto's patch to allow arbitrary specification
    of $startperl.  

    As requested, I have moved site_perl to be under
    $privlib, by default.  The default will now be
    /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl.  This is in accord with the way
    emacs used to do it :-).

Index: MANIFEST
    Add in POSIX.pod.  I didn't include Dean's mkposixman tool because
    it seemed to confuse MakeMaker, and I didn't want to manually fix
    the POSIX/Makefile.PL file today.

    Renamed minimod.PL.  The idea is as follows:  I'd like to reserve
    the .PL suffix for files that are extracted during build time, and
    then can be deleted after installation.  That is, it will be
    analogous to the .SH suffix.  For example, h2xs.PL creates
    h2xs, and a 'make realclean' will remove the h2xs.  Minimod.PL
    was an exception to this pattern.  Eventually, the .PL dependencies
    will be generated automatically, just as the .SH dependencies are
    now.

    Add in socket test.

Index: Configure

Upgraded to metaconfig PL60 (despite the erroneous metaconfig message.

Layed some groundwork for support on non Unix systems, such as OS/2.
Define things such as  .o vs. .obj,  '' vs. .exe, .a vs. .lib, etc.

Include I_LOCALE testing.

Include checks for new library set-up.  I don't want to ever have to
change this again.  It's documented more clearly in INSTALL.

Figure out correct string for $startperl (usually
#!/usr/local/bin/perl).

Improve signal detection even more.  Once again, the signal number
corresponding to sig_name[n] is n (up to NSIG-1).  Gaps in signal
numbers (e.g. on Solaris) are allowed and are filled with
innocuous names such as NUM37 NUM38, etc., where the 37 or 38
represents the actual signal number.

Index: INSTALL

Explain the library directory structure.

Remove some tailing whitespace.

Indicate that only the interfaces to gdbm and db are provided, not
the libraries themselves.

Add section on upgrading from previous versions of perl5.00x.

Mention how to override old config.sh with Configure -D and -O.

Index: MANIFEST

In an attempt to make the distribution slightly less Unix specific,
I've changed .SH extraction to a .PL extraction where possible.
That way folks on systems without a shell can still get the
auxilliarly files such as find2perl (assuming they *can* build
perl).

The emacs/ directory was hopelessly out of date.  I don't use emacs,
but included a current cperl-mode.el
