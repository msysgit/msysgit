4.38 beta           2006-04-13
------------------------------
  - SFX for installers now supports new properties in config file:
    Progress, Directory, ExecuteFile, ExecuteParameters.


4.34 beta           2006-02-27
------------------------------
  - ISetProperties::SetProperties:
      it's possible to specify desirable number of CPU threads: 
           PROPVARIANT: name=L"mt", vt = VT_UI4, ulVal = NumberOfThreads
      If "mt" is not defined, 7za.dll will check number of processors in system to set 
      number of desirable threads. 
      Now 7za.dll can use:
        2 threads for LZMA compressing
        N threads for BZip2 compressing
        4 threads for BZip2 decompressing
      Other codecs use only one thread. 
      Note: 7za.dll can use additional "small" threads with low CPU load.
  - It's possible to call ISetProperties::SetProperties to specify "mt" property for decoder.
