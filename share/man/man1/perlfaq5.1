.IX Title "PERLFAQ5 1"
.TH PERLFAQ5 1 "2006-01-07" "perl v5.8.8" "Perl Programmers Reference Guide"
.SH "NAME"
perlfaq5 \- Files and Formats ($Revision: 1.42 $, $Date: 2005/12/31 00:54:37 $)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This section deals with I/O and the \*(L"f\*(R" issues: filehandles, flushing,
formats, and footers.
.Sh "How do I flush/unbuffer an output filehandle?  Why must I do this?"
.IX Xref "flush buffer unbuffer autoflush"
.IX Subsection "How do I flush/unbuffer an output filehandle?  Why must I do this?"
Perl does not support truly unbuffered output (except
insofar as you can \f(CW\*(C`syswrite(OUT, $char, 1)\*(C'\fR), although it
does support is \*(L"command buffering\*(R", in which a physical
write is performed after every output command.
.PP
The C standard I/O library (stdio) normally buffers
characters sent to devices so that there isn't a system call
for each byte. In most stdio implementations, the type of
output buffering and the size of the buffer varies according
to the type of device. Perl's \fIprint()\fR and \fIwrite()\fR functions
normally buffer output, while \fIsyswrite()\fR bypasses buffering
all together.
.PP
If you want your output to be sent immediately when you
execute \fIprint()\fR or \fIwrite()\fR (for instance, for some network
protocols), you must set the handle's autoflush flag. This
flag is the Perl variable $| and when it is set to a true
value, Perl will flush the handle's buffer after each
\&\fIprint()\fR or \fIwrite()\fR. Setting $| affects buffering only for
the currently selected default file handle. You choose this
handle with the one argument \fIselect()\fR call (see
"$|" in perlvar and \*(L"select\*(R" in perlfunc).
.PP
Use \fIselect()\fR to choose the desired handle, then set its
per-filehandle variables.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $old_fh = select(OUTPUT_HANDLE);
\&    $| = 1;
\&    select($old_fh);
.Ve
.PP
Some idioms can handle this in a single statement:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    select((select(OUTPUT_HANDLE), $| = 1)[0]);
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $| = 1, select $_ for select OUTPUT_HANDLE;
.Ve
.PP
Some modules offer object-oriented access to handles and their
variables, although they may be overkill if this is the only
thing you do with them.  You can use IO::Handle:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use IO::Handle;
\&    open(DEV, ">/dev/printer");   # but is this?
\&    DEV->autoflush(1);
.Ve
.PP
or IO::Socket:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use IO::Socket;               # this one is kinda a pipe?
\&        my $sock = IO::Socket::INET->new( 'www.example.com:80' );
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $sock->autoflush();
.Ve
.Sh "How do I change one line in a file/delete a line in a file/insert a line in the middle of a file/append to the beginning of a file?"
.IX Xref "file, editing"
.IX Subsection "How do I change one line in a file/delete a line in a file/insert a line in the middle of a file/append to the beginning of a file?"
Use the Tie::File module, which is included in the standard
distribution since Perl 5.8.0.
.Sh "How do I count the number of lines in a file?"
.IX Xref "file, counting lines lines line"
.IX Subsection "How do I count the number of lines in a file?"
One fairly efficient way is to count newlines in the file. The
following program uses a feature of tr///, as documented in perlop.
If your text file doesn't end with a newline, then it's not really a
proper text file, so this may report one fewer line than you expect.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    $lines = 0;
\&    open(FILE, $filename) or die "Can't open `$filename': $!";
\&    while (sysread FILE, $buffer, 4096) {
\&        $lines += ($buffer =~ tr/\en//);
\&    }
\&    close FILE;
.Ve
.PP
This assumes no funny games with newline translations.
.ie n .Sh "How can I use Perl's ""\-i"" option from within a program?"
.el .Sh "How can I use Perl's \f(CW\-i\fP option from within a program?"
.IX Xref "-i in-place"
.IX Subsection "How can I use Perl's -i option from within a program?"
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR sets the value of Perl's \f(CW$^I\fR variable, which in turn affects
the behavior of \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR; see perlrun for more details.  By
modifying the appropriate variables directly, you can get the same
behavior within a larger program.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 13
\&     # ...
\&     {
\&        local($^I, @ARGV) = ('.orig', glob("*.c"));
\&        while (<>) {
\&           if ($. == 1) {
\&               print "This line should appear at the top of each file\en";
\&           }
\&           s/\eb(p)earl\eb/${1}erl/i;        # Correct typos, preserving case
\&           print;
\&           close ARGV if eof;              # Reset $.
\&        }
\&     }
\&     # $^I and @ARGV return to their old values here
.Ve
.PP
This block modifies all the \f(CW\*(C`.c\*(C'\fR files in the current directory,
leaving a backup of the original data from each file in a new
\&\f(CW\*(C`.c.orig\*(C'\fR file.
.Sh "How can I copy a file?"
.IX Xref "copy file, copy"
.IX Subsection "How can I copy a file?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
Use the File::Copy module. It comes with Perl and can do a
true copy across file systems, and it does its magic in
a portable fashion.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use File::Copy;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        copy( $original, $new_copy ) or die "Copy failed: $!";
.Ve
.PP
If you can't use File::Copy, you'll have to do the work yourself:
open the original file, open the destination file, then print
to the destination file as you read the original.
.Sh "How do I make a temporary file name?"
.IX Xref "file, temporary"
.IX Subsection "How do I make a temporary file name?"
If you don't need to know the name of the file, you can use \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR
with \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR in place of the file name.  The \f(CW\*(C`open()\*(C'\fR function
creates an anonymous temporary file.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        open my $tmp, '+>', undef or die $!;
.Ve
.PP
Otherwise, you can use the File::Temp module.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use File::Temp qw/ tempfile tempdir /;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $dir = tempdir( CLEANUP => 1 );
\&  ($fh, $filename) = tempfile( DIR => $dir );
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  # or if you don't need to know the filename
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $fh = tempfile( DIR => $dir );
.Ve
.PP
The File::Temp has been a standard module since Perl 5.6.1.  If you
don't have a modern enough Perl installed, use the \f(CW\*(C`new_tmpfile\*(C'\fR
class method from the IO::File module to get a filehandle opened for
reading and writing.  Use it if you don't need to know the file's name:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use IO::File;
\&    $fh = IO::File->new_tmpfile()
\&        or die "Unable to make new temporary file: $!";
.Ve
.PP
If you're committed to creating a temporary file by hand, use the
process \s-1ID\s0 and/or the current time\-value.  If you need to have many
temporary files in one process, use a counter:
.PP
.Vb 19
\&    BEGIN {
\&        use Fcntl;
\&        my $temp_dir = -d '/tmp' ? '/tmp' : $ENV{TMPDIR} || $ENV{TEMP};
\&        my $base_name = sprintf("%s/%d-%d-0000", $temp_dir, $$, time());
\&        sub temp_file {
\&            local *FH;
\&            my $count = 0;
\&            until (defined(fileno(FH)) || $count++ > 100) {
\&                $base_name =~ s/-(\ed+)$/"-" . (1 + $1)/e;
\&                # O_EXCL is required for security reasons.
\&                sysopen(FH, $base_name, O_WRONLY|O_EXCL|O_CREAT);
\&            }
\&            if (defined(fileno(FH))
\&                return (*FH, $base_name);
\&            } else {
\&                return ();
\&            }
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.Sh "How can I manipulate fixed-record-length files?"
.IX Xref "fixed-length file, fixed-length records"
.IX Subsection "How can I manipulate fixed-record-length files?"
The most efficient way is using \fIpack()\fR and
\&\fIunpack()\fR.  This is faster than using
\&\fIsubstr()\fR when taking many, many strings.  It is
slower for just a few.
.PP
Here is a sample chunk of code to break up and put back together again
some fixed-format input lines, in this case from the output of a normal,
Berkeley-style ps:
.PP
.Vb 14
\&    # sample input line:
\&    #   15158 p5  T      0:00 perl /home/tchrist/scripts/now-what
\&    my $PS_T = 'A6 A4 A7 A5 A*';
\&    open my $ps, '-|', 'ps';
\&    print scalar <$ps>;
\&    my @fields = qw( pid tt stat time command );
\&    while (<$ps>) {
\&        my %process;
\&        @process{@fields} = unpack($PS_T, $_);
\&        for my $field ( @fields ) {
\&            print "$field: <$process{$field}>\en";
\&        }
\&        print 'line=', pack($PS_T, @process{@fields} ), "\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
We've used a hash slice in order to easily handle the fields of each row.
Storing the keys in an array means it's easy to operate on them as a
group or loop over them with for. It also avoids polluting the program
with global variables and using symbolic references.
.Sh "How can I make a filehandle local to a subroutine?  How do I pass filehandles between subroutines?  How do I make an array of filehandles?"
.IX Xref "filehandle, local filehandle, passing filehandle, reference"
.IX Subsection "How can I make a filehandle local to a subroutine?  How do I pass filehandles between subroutines?  How do I make an array of filehandles?"
As of perl5.6, \fIopen()\fR autovivifies file and directory handles
as references if you pass it an uninitialized scalar variable.
You can then pass these references just like any other scalar,
and use them in the place of named handles.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        open my    $fh, $file_name;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        open local $fh, $file_name;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print $fh "Hello World!\en";
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        process_file( $fh );
.Ve
.PP
Before perl5.6, you had to deal with various typeglob idioms
which you may see in older code.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        open FILE, "> $filename";
\&        process_typeglob(   *FILE );
\&        process_reference( \e*FILE );
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        sub process_typeglob  { local *FH = shift; print FH  "Typeglob!" }
\&        sub process_reference { local $fh = shift; print $fh "Reference!" }
.Ve
.PP
If you want to create many anonymous handles, you should
check out the Symbol or IO::Handle modules.
.Sh "How can I use a filehandle indirectly?"
.IX Xref "filehandle, indirect"
.IX Subsection "How can I use a filehandle indirectly?"
An indirect filehandle is using something other than a symbol
in a place that a filehandle is expected.  Here are ways
to get indirect filehandles:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    $fh =   SOME_FH;       # bareword is strict-subs hostile
\&    $fh =  "SOME_FH";      # strict-refs hostile; same package only
\&    $fh =  *SOME_FH;       # typeglob
\&    $fh = \e*SOME_FH;       # ref to typeglob (bless-able)
\&    $fh =  *SOME_FH{IO};   # blessed IO::Handle from *SOME_FH typeglob
.Ve
.PP
Or, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR method from one of the IO::* modules to
create an anonymous filehandle, store that in a scalar variable,
and use it as though it were a normal filehandle.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use IO::Handle;                     # 5.004 or higher
\&    $fh = IO::Handle->new();
.Ve
.PP
Then use any of those as you would a normal filehandle.  Anywhere that
Perl is expecting a filehandle, an indirect filehandle may be used
instead. An indirect filehandle is just a scalar variable that contains
a filehandle.  Functions like \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR, or
the \f(CW\*(C`<FH>\*(C'\fR diamond operator will accept either a named filehandle
or a scalar variable containing one:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    ($ifh, $ofh, $efh) = (*STDIN, *STDOUT, *STDERR);
\&    print $ofh "Type it: ";
\&    $got = <$ifh>
\&    print $efh "What was that: $got";
.Ve
.PP
If you're passing a filehandle to a function, you can write
the function in two ways:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub accept_fh {
\&        my $fh = shift;
\&        print $fh "Sending to indirect filehandle\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Or it can localize a typeglob and use the filehandle directly:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub accept_fh {
\&        local *FH = shift;
\&        print  FH "Sending to localized filehandle\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Both styles work with either objects or typeglobs of real filehandles.
(They might also work with strings under some circumstances, but this
is risky.)
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    accept_fh(*STDOUT);
\&    accept_fh($handle);
.Ve
.PP
In the examples above, we assigned the filehandle to a scalar variable
before using it.  That is because only simple scalar variables, not
expressions or subscripts of hashes or arrays, can be used with
built-ins like \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, or the diamond operator.  Using
something other than a simple scalar variable as a filehandle is
illegal and won't even compile:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    @fd = (*STDIN, *STDOUT, *STDERR);
\&    print $fd[1] "Type it: ";                           # WRONG
\&    $got = <$fd[0]>                                     # WRONG
\&    print $fd[2] "What was that: $got";                 # WRONG
.Ve
.PP
With \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, you get around this by using a block and
an expression where you would place the filehandle:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    print  { $fd[1] } "funny stuff\en";
\&    printf { $fd[1] } "Pity the poor %x.\en", 3_735_928_559;
\&    # Pity the poor deadbeef.
.Ve
.PP
That block is a proper block like any other, so you can put more
complicated code there.  This sends the message out to one of two places:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $ok = -x "/bin/cat";
\&    print { $ok ? $fd[1] : $fd[2] } "cat stat $ok\en";
\&    print { $fd[ 1+ ($ok || 0) ]  } "cat stat $ok\en";
.Ve
.PP
This approach of treating \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR like object methods
calls doesn't work for the diamond operator.  That's because it's a
real operator, not just a function with a comma-less argument.  Assuming
you've been storing typeglobs in your structure as we did above, you
can use the built-in function named \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR to read a record just
as \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR does.  Given the initialization shown above for \f(CW@fd\fR, this
would work, but only because \fIreadline()\fR requires a typeglob.  It doesn't
work with objects or strings, which might be a bug we haven't fixed yet.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $got = readline($fd[0]);
.Ve
.PP
Let it be noted that the flakiness of indirect filehandles is not
related to whether they're strings, typeglobs, objects, or anything else.
It's the syntax of the fundamental operators.  Playing the object
game doesn't help you at all here.

full stops instead (or anything else that they want to use,
really).

The \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR operator performs a globbing operation (see above).
In Perl versions earlier than v5.6.0, the internal \fIglob()\fR operator forks
\&\fIcsh\fR\|(1) to do the actual glob expansion, but
csh can't handle more than 127 items and so gives the error message
\&\f(CW\*(C`Argument list too long\*(C'\fR.  People who installed tcsh as csh won't
have this problem, but their users may be surprised by it.
.PP
To get around this, either upgrade to Perl v5.6.0 or later, do the glob
yourself with \fIreaddir()\fR and patterns, or use a module like File::KGlob,
one that doesn't use the shell to do globbing.

Due to the current implementation on some operating systems, when you

best therefore to use \fIglob()\fR only in list context.

(contributed by Brian McCauley)
.PP
The special two argument form of Perl's \fIopen()\fR function ignores
trailing blanks in filenames and infers the mode from certain leading
characters (or a trailing \*(L"|\*(R"). In older versions of Perl this was the
only version of \fIopen()\fR and so it is prevalent in old code and books.
.PP
Unless you have a particular reason to use the two argument form you
should use the three argument form of \fIopen()\fR which does not treat any
charcters in the filename as special.
.PP

It may be more portable to use the File::Copy module instead.
You just copy to the new file to the new name (checking return
values), then delete the old one.  This isn't really the same
semantically as a \fIrename()\fR, which preserves meta-information like
permissions, timestamps, inode info, etc.
.PP
Newer versions of File::Copy export a \fImove()\fR function.
.Sh "How can I lock a file?"
.IX Xref "lock file, lock flock"
.IX Subsection "How can I lock a file?"
Perl's builtin \fIflock()\fR function (see perlfunc for details) will call
\&\fIflock\fR\|(2) if that exists, \fIfcntl\fR\|(2) if it doesn't (on perl version 5.004 and
later), and \fIlockf\fR\|(3) if neither of the two previous system calls exists.
On some systems, it may even use a different form of native locking.
Here are some gotchas with Perl's \fIflock()\fR:
.IP "1" 4
.IX Item "1"
Produces a fatal error if none of the three system calls (or their
close equivalent) exists.
.IP "2" 4
.IX Item "2"
\&\fIlockf\fR\|(3) does not provide shared locking, and requires that the
filehandle be open for writing (or appending, or read/writing).
.IP "3" 4
.IX Item "3"
Some versions of \fIflock()\fR can't lock files over a network (e.g. on \s-1NFS\s0 file
systems), so you'd need to force the use of \fIfcntl\fR\|(2) when you build Perl.
But even this is dubious at best.  See the flock entry of perlfunc
and the \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR file in the source distribution for information on
building Perl to do this.
.Sp
Two potentially non-obvious but traditional flock semantics are that
it waits indefinitely until the lock is granted, and that its locks are
\&\fImerely advisory\fR.  Such discretionary locks are more flexible, but
offer fewer guarantees.  This means that files locked with \fIflock()\fR may
be modified by programs that do not also use \fIflock()\fR.  Cars that stop
for red lights get on well with each other, but not with cars that don't
stop for red lights.  See the perlport manpage, your port's specific
documentation, or your system-specific local manpages for details.  It's
best to assume traditional behavior if you're writing portable programs.
(If you're not, you should as always feel perfectly free to write
for your own system's idiosyncrasies (sometimes called \*(L"features\*(R").
Slavish adherence to portability concerns shouldn't get in the way of
your getting your job done.)

except that lamentably, file creation (and deletion) is not atomic
over \s-1NFS\s0, so this won't work (at least, not every time) over the net.

these tend to involve busy\-wait, which is also subdesirable.

If you know you are only writing code to run on an \s-1OS\s0 and filesystem that

of the buffer then each bufferload is almost guaranteed to be written to
the end of the file in one chunk without getting intermingled with
anyone else's output. You can also use the \fIsyswrite()\fR function which is
simply a wrapper around your systems \fIwrite\fR\|(2) system call.

There is still a small theoretical chance that a signal will interrupt
the system level \fIwrite()\fR operation before completion.  There is also a

you use the \fB\-A\fR, \fB\-M\fR, or \fB\-C\fR file test operations as
documented in perlfunc.  These retrieve the age of the
file (measured against the start-time of your program) in
days as a floating point number. Some platforms may not have
all of these times.  See perlport for details. To
retrieve the \*(L"raw\*(R" time in seconds since the epoch, you
would call the stat function, then use \fIlocaltime()\fR,
\&\fIgmtime()\fR, or \fIPOSIX::strftime()\fR to convert this into
human-readable form.

Here's an example:

accessing an element the array actually accesses the corresponding

The Term::ReadKey module from \s-1CPAN\s0 may be easier to use.  Recent versions
include also support for non-portable systems as well.
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    use Term::ReadKey;
\&    open(TTY, "</dev/tty");
\&    print "Gimme a char: ";
\&    ReadMode "raw";
\&    $key = ReadKey 0, *TTY;
\&    ReadMode "normal";
\&    printf "\enYou said %s, char number %03d\en",
\&        $key, ord $key;
.Ve
.Sh "How can I tell whether there's a character waiting on a filehandle?"
.IX Subsection "How can I tell whether there's a character waiting on a filehandle?"
The very first thing you should do is look into getting the Term::ReadKey
extension from \s-1CPAN\s0.  As we mentioned earlier, it now even has limited
support for non-portable (read: not open systems, closed, proprietary,
not \s-1POSIX\s0, not Unix, etc) systems.
.PP
You should also check out the Frequently Asked Questions list in
comp.unix.* for things like this: the answer is essentially the same.
It's very system dependent.  Here's one solution that works on \s-1BSD\s0
systems:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    sub key_ready {
\&        my($rin, $nfd);
\&        vec($rin, fileno(STDIN), 1) = 1;
\&        return $nfd = select($rin,undef,undef,0);
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
If you want to find out how many characters are waiting, there's
also the \s-1FIONREAD\s0 ioctl call to be looked at.  The \fIh2ph\fR tool that
comes with Perl tries to convert C include files to Perl code, which
can be \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fRd.  \s-1FIONREAD\s0 ends up defined as a function in the
\&\fIsys/ioctl.ph\fR file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    require 'sys/ioctl.ph';
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $size = pack("L", 0);
\&    ioctl(FH, FIONREAD(), $size)    or die "Couldn't call ioctl: $!\en";
\&    $size = unpack("L", $size);
.Ve
.PP
If \fIh2ph\fR wasn't installed or doesn't work for you, you can
\&\fIgrep\fR the include files by hand:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    % grep FIONREAD /usr/include/*/*
\&    /usr/include/asm/ioctls.h:#define FIONREAD      0x541B
.Ve
.PP
Or write a small C program using the editor of champions:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    % cat > fionread.c
\&    #include <sys/ioctl.h>
\&    main() {
\&        printf("%#08x\en", FIONREAD);
\&    }
\&    ^D
\&    % cc -o fionread fionread.c
\&    % ./fionread
\&    0x4004667f
.Ve
.PP
And then hard code it, leaving porting as an exercise to your successor.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $FIONREAD = 0x4004667f;         # XXX: opsys dependent
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $size = pack("L", 0);
\&    ioctl(FH, $FIONREAD, $size)     or die "Couldn't call ioctl: $!\en";
\&    $size = unpack("L", $size);
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1FIONREAD\s0 requires a filehandle connected to a stream, meaning that sockets,
pipes, and tty devices work, but \fInot\fR files.
.ie n .Sh "How do I do a ""tail \-f"" in perl?"

.IX Subsection "How do I do a tail -f in perl?"
First try
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    seek(GWFILE, 0, 1);
.Ve
.PP
The statement \f(CW\*(C`seek(GWFILE, 0, 1)\*(C'\fR doesn't change the current position,
but it does clear the end-of-file condition on the handle, so that the
next <\s-1GWFILE\s0> makes Perl try again to read something.
.PP
If that doesn't work (it relies on features of your stdio implementation),
then you need something more like this:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        for (;;) {
\&          for ($curpos = tell(GWFILE); <GWFILE>; $curpos = tell(GWFILE)) {
\&            # search for some stuff and put it into files
\&          }
\&          # sleep for a while
\&          seek(GWFILE, $curpos, 0);  # seek to where we had been
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
If this still doesn't work, look into the \s-1POSIX\s0 module.  \s-1POSIX\s0 defines
the \fIclearerr()\fR method, which can remove the end of file condition on a
filehandle.  The method: read until end of file, \fIclearerr()\fR, read some
more.  Lather, rinse, repeat.
.PP
There's also a File::Tail module from \s-1CPAN\s0.
.Sh "How do I \fIdup()\fP a filehandle in Perl?"
.IX Xref "dup"
.IX Subsection "How do I dup() a filehandle in Perl?"
If you check \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc, you'll see that several of the ways
to call \fIopen()\fR should do the trick.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    open(LOG, ">>/foo/logfile");
\&    open(STDERR, ">&LOG");
.Ve
.PP
Or even with a literal numeric descriptor:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   $fd = $ENV{MHCONTEXTFD};
\&   open(MHCONTEXT, "<&=$fd");   # like fdopen(3S)
.Ve
.PP
Note that \*(L"<&STDIN\*(R" makes a copy, but \*(L"<&=STDIN\*(R" make
an alias.  That means if you close an aliased handle, all
aliases become inaccessible.  This is not true with
a copied one.
.PP
Error checking, as always, has been left as an exercise for the reader.
.Sh "How do I close a file descriptor by number?"
.IX Xref "file, closing file descriptors"
.IX Subsection "How do I close a file descriptor by number?"
This should rarely be necessary, as the Perl \fIclose()\fR function is to be
used for things that Perl opened itself, even if it was a dup of a
numeric descriptor as with \s-1MHCONTEXT\s0 above.  But if you really have
to, you may be able to do this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    require 'sys/syscall.ph';
\&    $rc = syscall(&SYS_close, $fd + 0);  # must force numeric
\&    die "can't sysclose $fd: $!" unless $rc == -1;
.Ve
.PP
Or, just use the fdopen(3S) feature of \fIopen()\fR:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    {
\&        local *F;
\&        open F, "<&=$fd" or die "Cannot reopen fd=$fd: $!";
\&        close F;
\&    }
.Ve
.ie n .Sh "Why can't I use ""C:\etemp\efoo"" in \s-1DOS\s0 paths?  Why doesn't `C:\etemp\efoo.exe` work?"
.el .Sh "Why can't I use ``C:\etemp\efoo'' in \s-1DOS\s0 paths?  Why doesn't `C:\etemp\efoo.exe` work?"
.IX Xref "filename, DOS issues"
.IX Subsection "Why can't I use C:tempfoo in DOS paths?  Why doesn't `C:tempfoo.exe` work?"
Whoops!  You just put a tab and a formfeed into that filename!
Remember that within double quoted strings (\*(L"like\ethis\*(R"), the
backslash is an escape character.  The full list of these is in
\&\*(L"Quote and Quote-like Operators\*(R" in perlop.  Unsurprisingly, you don't
have a file called \*(L"c:(tab)emp(formfeed)oo\*(R" or
\&\*(L"c:(tab)emp(formfeed)oo.exe\*(R" on your legacy \s-1DOS\s0 filesystem.
.PP
Either single-quote your strings, or (preferably) use forward slashes.
Since all \s-1DOS\s0 and Windows versions since something like MS-DOS 2.0 or so
have treated \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR the same in a path, you might as well use the
one that doesn't clash with Perl\*(--or the \s-1POSIX\s0 shell, \s-1ANSI\s0 C and \*(C+,
awk, Tcl, Java, or Python, just to mention a few.  \s-1POSIX\s0 paths
are more portable, too.

.el .Sh "Why doesn't glob(``*.*'') get all the files?"
.IX Xref "glob"
.IX Subsection "Why doesn't glob(*.*) get all the files?"
Because even on non-Unix ports, Perl's glob function follows standard
Unix globbing semantics.  You'll need \f(CW\*(C`glob("*")\*(C'\fR to get all (non\-hidden)
files.  This makes \fIglob()\fR portable even to legacy systems.  Your
port may include proprietary globbing functions as well.  Check its
documentation for details.

This is elaborately and painstakingly described in the

Know\*(R" collection in http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz .

The executive summary: learn how your filesystem works.  The
permissions on a file say what can happen to the data in that file.
The permissions on a directory say what can happen to the list of
files in that directory.  If you delete a file, you're removing its
name from the directory (so the operation depends on the permissions
of the directory, not of the file).  If you try to write to the file,
the permissions of the file govern whether you're allowed to.

Here's an algorithm from the Camel Book:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    srand;
\&    rand($.) < 1 && ($line = $_) while <>;
.Ve
.PP
This has a significant advantage in space over reading the whole file
in.  You can find a proof of this method in \fIThe Art of Computer
Programming\fR, Volume 2, Section 3.4.2, by Donald E. Knuth.
.PP
You can use the File::Random module which provides a function
for that algorithm:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        use File::Random qw/random_line/;
\&        my $line = random_line($filename);
.Ve
.PP
Another way is to use the Tie::File module, which treats the entire
file as an array.  Simply access a random array element.

statement would print

.Ve
.PP
but if each element of \f(CW@lines\fR was a line of text, ending a newline
character \f(CW\*(C`("little\en", "fluffy\en", "clouds\en")\*(C'\fR then it would print:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    little
\&     fluffy
\&     clouds

If your array contains lines, just print them:
