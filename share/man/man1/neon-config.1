.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The \fBneon\-config\fR script provides information about an installed copy of the neon library\&. The \fB\-\-cflags\fR and \fB\-\-libs\fR options instruct how to compile and link an application against the library; the \fB\-\-version\fR and \fB\-\-support\fR options can help determine whether the library meets the applications requirements\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-\-cflags\fR
Print the flags which should be passed to the C compiler when compiling object files, when the object files use neon header files\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-libs\fR
Print the flags which should be passed to the linker when linking an application which uses the neon library

.TP
\fB\-\-la\-file\fR
Print the location of the libtool library script, \fIlibneon\&.la\fR, which can be used to link against neon by applications using libtool\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version of the library

.TP
\fB\-\-prefix\fR \fIdir\fR
If \fIdir\fR is given; relocate output of \fB\-\-cflags\fR and \fB\-\-libs\fR as if neon was installed in given prefix directory\&. Otherwise, print the installation prefix of the library\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-support\fR \fIfeature\fR
The script exits with success if \fIfeature\fR is supported by the library\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print help message; includes list of known features and whether they are supported or not\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.PP
Below is a Makefile fragment which could be used to build an application against an installed neon library, when the \fBneon\-config\fR script can be found in \fB$PATH\fR\&.
