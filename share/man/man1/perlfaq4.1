.SH "NAME"
perlfaq4 \- Data Manipulation ($Revision: 1.73 $, $Date: 2005/12/31 00:54:37 $)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This section of the \s-1FAQ\s0 answers questions related to manipulating
numbers, dates, strings, arrays, hashes, and miscellaneous data issues.
.SH "Data: Numbers"
.IX Header "Data: Numbers"
.Sh "Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)?"
.IX Subsection "Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)?"
Internally, your computer represents floating-point numbers
in binary. Digital (as in powers of two) computers cannot
store all numbers exactly.  Some real numbers lose precision
in the process.  This is a problem with how computers store
numbers and affects all computer languages, not just Perl.
.PP
perlnumber show the gory details of number
representations and conversions.
.PP
To limit the number of decimal places in your numbers, you
can use the printf or sprintf function.  See the
\&\*(L"Floating Point Arithmetic\*(R" for more details.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        printf "%.2f", 10/3;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        my $number = sprintf "%.2f", 10/3;
.Ve
.Sh "Why is \fIint()\fP broken?"
.IX Subsection "Why is int() broken?"
Your \fIint()\fR is most probably working just fine.  It's the numbers that
aren't quite what you think.
.PP
First, see the above item \*(L"Why am I getting long decimals
(eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting
(eg, 19.95)?\*(R".
.PP
For example, this
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print int(0.6/0.2-2), "\en";
.Ve
.PP
will in most computers print 0, not 1, because even such simple
numbers as 0.6 and 0.2 cannot be presented exactly by floating-point
numbers.  What you think in the above as 'three' is really more like
2.9999999999999995559.
.Sh "Why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly?"
.IX Subsection "Why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly?"
Perl only understands octal and hex numbers as such when they occur as
literals in your program.  Octal literals in perl must start with a
leading \*(L"0\*(R" and hexadecimal literals must start with a leading \*(L"0x\*(R".
If they are read in from somewhere and assigned, no automatic
conversion takes place.  You must explicitly use \fIoct()\fR or \fIhex()\fR if you
want the values converted to decimal.  \fIoct()\fR interprets hex (\*(L"0x350\*(R"),
octal (\*(L"0350\*(R" or even without the leading \*(L"0\*(R", like \*(L"377\*(R") and binary
(\*(L"0b1010\*(R") numbers, while \fIhex()\fR only converts hexadecimal ones, with
or without a leading \*(L"0x\*(R", like \*(L"0x255\*(R", \*(L"3A\*(R", \*(L"ff\*(R", or \*(L"deadbeef\*(R".
The inverse mapping from decimal to octal can be done with either the
\&\*(L"%o\*(R" or \*(L"%O\*(R" \fIsprintf()\fR formats.
.PP
This problem shows up most often when people try using \fIchmod()\fR, \fImkdir()\fR,
\&\fIumask()\fR, or \fIsysopen()\fR, which by widespread tradition typically take
permissions in octal.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    chmod(644,  $file); # WRONG
\&    chmod(0644, $file); # right
.Ve
.PP
Note the mistake in the first line was specifying the decimal literal
644, rather than the intended octal literal 0644.  The problem can
be seen with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    printf("%#o",644); # prints 01204
.Ve
.PP
Surely you had not intended \f(CW\*(C`chmod(01204, $file);\*(C'\fR \- did you?  If you
want to use numeric literals as arguments to \fIchmod()\fR et al. then please
try to express them as octal constants, that is with a leading zero and
with the following digits restricted to the set 0..7.
.Sh "Does Perl have a \fIround()\fP function?  What about \fIceil()\fP and \fIfloor()\fP?  Trig functions?"
.IX Subsection "Does Perl have a round() function?  What about ceil() and floor()?  Trig functions?"
Remember that \fIint()\fR merely truncates toward 0.  For rounding to a
certain number of digits, \fIsprintf()\fR or \fIprintf()\fR is usually the easiest
route.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    printf("%.3f", 3.1415926535);       # prints 3.142
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1POSIX\s0 module (part of the standard Perl distribution) implements
\&\fIceil()\fR, \fIfloor()\fR, and a number of other mathematical and trigonometric
functions.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use POSIX;
\&    $ceil   = ceil(3.5);                        # 4
\&    $floor  = floor(3.5);                       # 3
.Ve
.PP
In 5.000 to 5.003 perls, trigonometry was done in the Math::Complex
module.  With 5.004, the Math::Trig module (part of the standard Perl
distribution) implements the trigonometric functions. Internally it
uses the Math::Complex module and some functions can break out from
the real axis into the complex plane, for example the inverse sine of
2.
.PP
Rounding in financial applications can have serious implications, and
the rounding method used should be specified precisely.  In these
cases, it probably pays not to trust whichever system rounding is
being used by Perl, but to instead implement the rounding function you
need yourself.
.PP
To see why, notice how you'll still have an issue on half-way-point
alternation:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    for ($i = 0; $i < 1.01; $i += 0.05) { printf "%.1f ",$i}
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    0.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7
\&    0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9 1.0 1.0
.Ve
.PP
Don't blame Perl.  It's the same as in C.  \s-1IEEE\s0 says we have to do this.
Perl numbers whose absolute values are integers under 2**31 (on 32 bit
machines) will work pretty much like mathematical integers.  Other numbers
are not guaranteed.
.Sh "How do I convert between numeric representations/bases/radixes?"
.IX Subsection "How do I convert between numeric representations/bases/radixes?"
As always with Perl there is more than one way to do it.  Below
are a few examples of approaches to making common conversions
between number representations.  This is intended to be representational
rather than exhaustive.
.PP
Some of the examples below use the Bit::Vector module from \s-1CPAN\s0.
The reason you might choose Bit::Vector over the perl built in
functions is that it works with numbers of \s-1ANY\s0 size, that it is
optimized for speed on some operations, and for at least some
programmers the notation might be familiar.

are left as an exercise to the inclined reader.
.Sh "Why doesn't & work the way I want it to?"
.IX Subsection "Why doesn't & work the way I want it to?"
The behavior of binary arithmetic operators depends on whether they're
used on numbers or strings.  The operators treat a string as a series
of bits and work with that (the string \f(CW"3"\fR is the bit pattern
\&\f(CW00110011\fR).  The operators work with the binary form of a number
(the number \f(CW3\fR is treated as the bit pattern \f(CW00000011\fR).
.PP
So, saying \f(CW\*(C`11 & 3\*(C'\fR performs the \*(L"and\*(R" operation on numbers (yielding
\&\f(CW3\fR).  Saying \f(CW"11" & "3"\fR performs the \*(L"and\*(R" operation on strings
(yielding \f(CW"1"\fR).
.PP
Most problems with \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR arise because the programmer thinks
they have a number but really it's a string.  The rest arise because
the programmer says:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    if ("\e020\e020" & "\e101\e101") {
\&        # ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
but a string consisting of two null bytes (the result of \f(CW\*(C`"\e020\e020"
& "\e101\e101"\*(C'\fR) is not a false value in Perl.  You need:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    if ( ("\e020\e020" & "\e101\e101") !~ /[^\e000]/) {
\&        # ...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sh "How do I multiply matrices?"
.IX Subsection "How do I multiply matrices?"
Use the Math::Matrix or Math::MatrixReal modules (available from \s-1CPAN\s0)
or the \s-1PDL\s0 extension (also available from \s-1CPAN\s0).
.Sh "How do I perform an operation on a series of integers?"
.IX Subsection "How do I perform an operation on a series of integers?"
To call a function on each element in an array, and collect the
results, use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @results = map { my_func($_) } @array;
.Ve
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @triple = map { 3 * $_ } @single;
.Ve
.PP
To call a function on each element of an array, but ignore the
results:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    foreach $iterator (@array) {
\&        some_func($iterator);
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
To call a function on each integer in a (small) range, you \fBcan\fR use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @results = map { some_func($_) } (5 .. 25);
.Ve
.PP
but you should be aware that the \f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR operator creates an array of
all integers in the range.  This can take a lot of memory for large
ranges.  Instead use:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    @results = ();
\&    for ($i=5; $i < 500_005; $i++) {
\&        push(@results, some_func($i));
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
This situation has been fixed in Perl5.005. Use of \f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR in a \f(CW\*(C`for\*(C'\fR
loop will iterate over the range, without creating the entire range.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    for my $i (5 .. 500_005) {
\&        push(@results, some_func($i));
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
will not create a list of 500,000 integers.

.Sh "Why aren't my random numbers random?"
.IX Subsection "Why aren't my random numbers random?"
If you're using a version of Perl before 5.004, you must call \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR
once at the start of your program to seed the random number generator.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&         BEGIN { srand() if $] < 5.004 }
.Ve
.PP
5.004 and later automatically call \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR at the beginning.  Don't
call \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR more than once\-\-\-you make your numbers less random, rather
than more.
.PP
Computers are good at being predictable and bad at being random
(despite appearances caused by bugs in your programs :\-).  see the
\&\fIrandom\fR article in the \*(L"Far More Than You Ever Wanted To Know\*(R"
collection in http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz , courtesy of
Tom Phoenix, talks more about this.  John von Neumann said, \*(L"Anyone
who attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is, of
course, living in a state of sin.\*(R"
.PP
If you want numbers that are more random than \f(CW\*(C`rand\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`srand\*(C'\fR
provides, you should also check out the Math::TrulyRandom module from
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.  It uses the imperfections in your system's timer to generate
random numbers, but this takes quite a while.  If you want a better
pseudorandom generator than comes with your operating system, look at
\&\*(L"Numerical Recipes in C\*(R" at http://www.nr.com/ .
.Sh "How do I get a random number between X and Y?"
.IX Subsection "How do I get a random number between X and Y?"
\&\f(CW\*(C`rand($x)\*(C'\fR returns a number such that
\&\f(CW\*(C`0 <= rand($x) < $x\*(C'\fR. Thus what you want to have perl
figure out is a random number in the range from 0 to the
difference between your \fIX\fR and \fIY\fR.
.PP
That is, to get a number between 10 and 15, inclusive, you
want a random number between 0 and 5 that you can then add
to 10.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $number = 10 + int rand( 15-10+1 );
.Ve
.PP
Hence you derive the following simple function to abstract
that. It selects a random integer between the two given
integers (inclusive), For example: \f(CW\*(C`random_int_in(50,120)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&   sub random_int_in ($$) {
\&     my($min, $max) = @_;
\&      # Assumes that the two arguments are integers themselves!
\&     return $min if $min == $max;
\&     ($min, $max) = ($max, $min)  if  $min > $max;
\&     return $min + int rand(1 + $max - $min);

.Sh "Does Perl have a Year 2000 problem?  Is Perl Y2K compliant?"
.IX Subsection "Does Perl have a Year 2000 problem?  Is Perl Y2K compliant?"
Short answer: No, Perl does not have a Year 2000 problem.  Yes, Perl is
Y2K compliant (whatever that means).  The programmers you've hired to
use it, however, probably are not.
.PP
Long answer: The question belies a true understanding of the issue.
Perl is just as Y2K compliant as your pencil\*(--no more, and no less.
Can you use your pencil to write a non\-Y2K\-compliant memo?  Of course
you can.  Is that the pencil's fault?  Of course it isn't.
.PP
The date and time functions supplied with Perl (gmtime and localtime)
supply adequate information to determine the year well beyond 2000
(2038 is when trouble strikes for 32\-bit machines).  The year returned
by these functions when used in a list context is the year minus 1900.
For years between 1910 and 1999 this \fIhappens\fR to be a 2\-digit decimal
number. To avoid the year 2000 problem simply do not treat the year as
a 2\-digit number.  It isn't.
.PP
When \fIgmtime()\fR and \fIlocaltime()\fR are used in scalar context they return
a timestamp string that contains a fully-expanded year.  For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`$timestamp = gmtime(1005613200)\*(C'\fR sets \f(CW$timestamp\fR to \*(L"Tue Nov 13 01:00:00
2001\*(R".  There's no year 2000 problem here.
.PP
That doesn't mean that Perl can't be used to create non\-Y2K compliant
programs.  It can.  But so can your pencil.  It's the fault of the user,
not the language.  At the risk of inflaming the \s-1NRA:\s0 \*(L"Perl doesn't
break Y2K, people do.\*(R"  See http://www.perl.org/about/y2k.html for

There are many ways to ensure that values are what you expect or

.IX Subsection "How do I remove consecutive pairs of characters?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
You can use the substitution operator to find pairs of characters (or
runs of characters) and replace them with a single instance. In this
substitution, we find a character in \f(CW\*(C`(.)\*(C'\fR. The memory parentheses
store the matched character in the back-reference \f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR and we use
that to require that the same thing immediately follow it. We replace
that part of the string with the character in \f(CW$1\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    s/(.)\e1/$1/g;
.Ve
.PP
We can also use the transliteration operator, \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR. In this
example, the search list side of our \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR contains nothing, but
the \f(CW\*(C`c\*(C'\fR option complements that so it contains everything. The
replacement list also contains nothing, so the transliteration is
almost a no-op since it won't do any replacements (or more exactly,
replace the character with itself). However, the \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR option squashes
duplicated and consecutive characters in the string so a character
does not show up next to itself

.IX Subsection "How do I expand function calls in a string?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
This is documented in perlref, and although it's not the easiest
thing to read, it does work. In each of these examples, we call the
function inside the braces used to dereference a reference. If we
have a more than one return value, we can construct and dereference an
anonymous array. In this case, we call the function in list context.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print "The time values are @{ [localtime] }.\en";
.Ve
.PP
If we want to call the function in scalar context, we have to do a bit
more work. We can really have any code we like inside the braces, so
we simply have to end with the scalar reference, although how you do
that is up to you, and you can use code inside the braces.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print "The time is ${\e(scalar localtime)}.\en"

the reference yourself.

.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print "The time is ${ timestamp() }.\en";
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Interpolation\*(C'\fR module can also do a lot of magic for you. You can
specify a variable name, in this case \f(CW\*(C`E\*(C'\fR, to set up a tied hash that
does the interpolation for you. It has several other methods to do this
as well.

This isn't something that can be done in one regular expression, no
matter how complicated.  To find something between two single
characters, a pattern like \f(CW\*(C`/x([^x]*)x/\*(C'\fR will get the intervening
bits in \f(CW$1\fR. For multiple ones, then something more like
\&\f(CW\*(C`/alpha(.*?)omega/\*(C'\fR would be needed.  But none of these deals with
nested patterns.  For balanced expressions using \f(CW\*(C`(\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR as delimiters, use the \s-1CPAN\s0 module Regexp::Common, or see
\&\*(L"(??{ code })\*(R" in perlre.  For other cases, you'll have to write a
parser.
.PP
If you are serious about writing a parser, there are a number of
modules or oddities that will make your life a lot easier.  There are
the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules Parse::RecDescent, Parse::Yapp, and Text::Balanced;
and the byacc program.   Starting from perl 5.8 the Text::Balanced is
part of the standard distribution.

This is fine if you are just looking for a single character.  However,
if you are trying to count multiple character substrings within a
larger string, \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR won't work.  What you can do is wrap a \fIwhile()\fR
loop around a global pattern match.  For example, let's count negative

For a multi-line string, you can apply the regular expression
to each logical line in the string by adding the \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR flag (for
\&\*(L"multi\-line\*(R"). With the \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR flag, the \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR matches \fIbefore\fR an
embedded newline, so it doesn't remove it. It still removes the
newline at the end of the string.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $string =~ s/^\es+|\es+$//gm;
.Ve
.PP
Remember that lines consisting entirely of whitespace will disappear,
since the first part of the alternation can match the entire string
and replace it with nothing. If need to keep embedded blank lines,
you have to do a little more work. Instead of matching any whitespace
(since that includes a newline), just match the other whitespace.

In the following examples, \f(CW$pad_len\fR is the length to which you wish
to pad the string, \f(CW$text\fR or \f(CW$num\fR contains the string to be padded,
and \f(CW$pad_char\fR contains the padding character. You can use a single
character string constant instead of the \f(CW$pad_char\fR variable if you
know what it is in advance. And in the same way you can use an integer in

.PP
The simplest method uses the \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR function. It can pad on the left
or right with blanks and on the left with zeroes and it will not
truncate the result. The \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR function can only pad strings on the

You can use a substitution with a double evaluation.  The

.Sh "What is the difference between a list and an array?"
.IX Subsection "What is the difference between a list and an array?"
An array has a changeable length.  A list does not.  An array is something
you can push or pop, while a list is a set of values.  Some people make
the distinction that a list is a value while an array is a variable.
Subroutines are passed and return lists, you put things into list
context, you initialize arrays with lists, and you \fIforeach()\fR across
a list.  \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR variables are arrays, anonymous arrays are arrays, arrays
in scalar context behave like the number of elements in them, subroutines
access their arguments through the array \f(CW@_\fR, and push/pop/shift only work
on arrays.
.PP
As a side note, there's no such thing as a list in scalar context.
When you say
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $scalar = (2, 5, 7, 9);
.Ve
.PP
you're using the comma operator in scalar context, so it uses the scalar
comma operator.  There never was a list there at all!  This causes the
last value to be returned: 9.
.ie n .Sh "What is the difference between $array\fP[1] and \f(CW@array[1]?"
.el .Sh "What is the difference between \f(CW$array\fP[1] and \f(CW@array\fP[1]?"
.IX Subsection "What is the difference between $array[1] and @array[1]?"
The former is a scalar value; the latter an array slice, making
it a list with one (scalar) value.  You should use $ when you want a
scalar value (most of the time) and @ when you want a list with one
scalar value in it (very, very rarely; nearly never, in fact).
.PP
Sometimes it doesn't make a difference, but sometimes it does.
For example, compare:
.PP
.Vb 1

Use a hash. When you think the words \*(L"unique\*(R" or \*(L"duplicated\*(R", think
\&\*(L"hash keys\*(R".
.PP
If you don't care about the order of the elements, you could just
create the hash then extract the keys. It's not important how you
create that hash: just that you use \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR to get the unique
elements.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   my %hash   = map { $_, 1 } @array;

\&   # or a foreach: $hash{$_} = 1 foreach ( @array );
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   my @unique = keys %hash;
.Ve
.PP
You can also go through each element and skip the ones you've seen
before. Use a hash to keep track. The first time the loop sees an
element, that element has no key in \f(CW%Seen\fR. The \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR statement
creates the key and immediately uses its value, which is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, so
the loop continues to the \f(CW\*(C`push\*(C'\fR and increments the value for that
key. The next time the loop sees that same element, its key exists in
the hash \fIand\fR the value for that key is true (since it's not 0 or
undef), so the next skips that iteration and the loop goes to the next
element.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        my @unique = ();
\&        my %seen   = ();
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        foreach my $elem ( @array )

\&                push @unique, $elem;

Hearing the word \*(L"in\*(R" is an \fIin\fRdication that you probably should have
used a hash, not a list or array, to store your data.  Hashes are
designed to answer this question quickly and efficiently.  Arrays aren't.
.PP
That being said, there are several ways to approach this.  If you
are going to make this query many times over arbitrary string values,
the fastest way is probably to invert the original array and maintain a
hash whose keys are the first array's values.
.PP

\&    %is_blue = ();

.PP
Now you can check whether \f(CW$is_blue\fR{$some_color}.  It might have been a
good idea to keep the blues all in a hash in the first place.
.PP
If the values are all small integers, you could use a simple indexed
array.  This kind of an array will take up less space:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    @primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31);
\&    @is_tiny_prime = ();
\&    for (@primes) { $is_tiny_prime[$_] = 1 }
\&    # or simply  @istiny_prime[@primes] = (1) x @primes;
.Ve
.PP
Now you check whether \f(CW$is_tiny_prime\fR[$some_number].
.PP
If the values in question are integers instead of strings, you can save
quite a lot of space by using bit strings instead:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    @articles = ( 1..10, 150..2000, 2017 );
\&    undef $read;
\&    for (@articles) { vec($read,$_,1) = 1 }
.Ve
.PP
Now check whether \f(CW\*(C`vec($read,$n,1)\*(C'\fR is true for some \f(CW$n\fR.
.PP
These methods guarantee fast individual tests but require a re-organization
of the original list or array.  They only pay off if you have to test
multiple values against the same array.
.PP
If you are testing only once, the standard module List::Util exports
the function \f(CW\*(C`first\*(C'\fR for this purpose.  It works by stopping once it
finds the element. It's written in C for speed, and its Perl equivalant
looks like this subroutine:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        sub first (&@) {
\&                my $code = shift;
\&                foreach (@_) {
\&                        return $_ if &{$code}();
\&                }
\&                undef;
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
If speed is of little concern, the common idiom uses grep in scalar context
(which returns the number of items that passed its condition) to traverse the
entire list. This does have the benefit of telling you how many matches it
found, though.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        my $is_there = grep $_ eq $whatever, @array;

\&            : "different";

we'll demonstrate two different answers:

The first reports that both those the hashes contain the same data,
while the second reports that they do not.  Which you prefer is left as

regular arrays, you can push and pop or shift and unshift at either end,
or you can use splice to add and/or remove arbitrary number of elements at
arbitrary points.  Both pop and shift are both O(1) operations on Perl's
dynamic arrays.  In the absence of shifts and pops, push in general
needs to reallocate on the order every log(N) times, and unshift will
need to copy pointers each time.
.PP
If you really, really wanted, you could use structures as described in
perldsc or perltoot and do just what the algorithm book tells you
to do.  For example, imagine a list node like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $node = {
\&        VALUE => 42,
\&        LINK  => undef,
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
You could walk the list this way:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    print "List: ";
\&    for ($node = $head;  $node; $node = $node->{LINK}) {
\&        print $node->{VALUE}, " ";
\&    }
\&    print "\en";
.Ve
.PP
You could add to the list this way:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    my ($head, $tail);
\&    $tail = append($head, 1);       # grow a new head
\&    for $value ( 2 .. 10 ) {
\&        $tail = append($tail, $value);
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 11
\&    sub append {
\&        my($list, $value) = @_;
\&        my $node = { VALUE => $value };
\&        if ($list) {
\&            $node->{LINK} = $list->{LINK};
\&            $list->{LINK} = $node;
\&        } else {
\&            $_[0] = $node;      # replace caller's version
\&        }
\&        return $node;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
But again, Perl's built-in are virtually always good enough.
.Sh "How do I handle circular lists?"
.IX Subsection "How do I handle circular lists?"
Circular lists could be handled in the traditional fashion with linked
lists, or you could just do something like this with an array:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    unshift(@array, pop(@array));  # the last shall be first
\&    push(@array, shift(@array));   # and vice versa
.Ve
.Sh "How do I shuffle an array randomly?"
.IX Subsection "How do I shuffle an array randomly?"
If you either have Perl 5.8.0 or later installed, or if you have
Scalar-List-Utils 1.03 or later installed, you can say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use List::Util 'shuffle';
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        @shuffled = shuffle(@list);
.Ve
.PP
If not, you can use a Fisher-Yates shuffle.
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    sub fisher_yates_shuffle {
\&        my $deck = shift;  # $deck is a reference to an array
\&        my $i = @$deck;
\&        while (--$i) {
\&            my $j = int rand ($i+1);
\&            @$deck[$i,$j] = @$deck[$j,$i];
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    # shuffle my mpeg collection
\&    #
\&    my @mpeg = <audio/*/*.mp3>;
\&    fisher_yates_shuffle( \e@mpeg );    # randomize @mpeg in place
\&    print @mpeg;
.Ve
.PP
Note that the above implementation shuffles an array in place,
unlike the \fIList::Util::shuffle()\fR which takes a list and returns
a new shuffled list.
.PP
You've probably seen shuffling algorithms that work using splice,
randomly picking another element to swap the current element with
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    srand;
\&    @new = ();
\&    @old = 1 .. 10;  # just a demo
\&    while (@old) {
\&        push(@new, splice(@old, rand @old, 1));
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
This is bad because splice is already O(N), and since you do it N times,
you just invented a quadratic algorithm; that is, O(N**2).  This does
not scale, although Perl is so efficient that you probably won't notice
this until you have rather largish arrays.
.Sh "How do I process/modify each element of an array?"
.IX Subsection "How do I process/modify each element of an array?"
Use \f(CW\*(C`for\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    for (@lines) {
\&                s/foo/bar/;     # change that word
\&                tr/XZ/ZX/;      # swap those letters
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Here's another; let's compute spherical volumes:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    for (@volumes = @radii) {   # @volumes has changed parts
\&                $_ **= 3;
\&                $_ *= (4/3) * 3.14159;  # this will be constant folded
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
which can also be done with \fImap()\fR which is made to transform
one list into another:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        @volumes = map {$_ ** 3 * (4/3) * 3.14159} @radii;
.Ve
.PP
If you want to do the same thing to modify the values of the
hash, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR function.  As of Perl 5.6
the values are not copied, so if you modify \f(CW$orbit\fR (in this
case), you modify the value.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    for $orbit ( values %orbits ) {
\&                ($orbit **= 3) *= (4/3) * 3.14159;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Prior to perl 5.6 \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR returned copies of the values,
so older perl code often contains constructions such as
\&\f(CW@orbits{keys %orbits}\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`values %orbits\*(C'\fR where
the hash is to be modified.
.Sh "How do I select a random element from an array?"

Use the \fIrand()\fR function (see \*(L"rand\*(R" in perlfunc):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $index   = rand @array;

.Ve

Or, simply:
    my \f(CW$element\fR = \f(CW$array\fR[ rand \f(CW@array\fR ];
.Sh "How do I permute N elements of a list?"

Use the List::Permutor module on \s-1CPAN\s0.  If the list is
actually an array, try the Algorithm::Permute module (also
on \s-1CPAN\s0).  It's written in \s-1XS\s0 code and is very efficient.
.PP

\&           print "next permutation: (@perm)\en";
\&        }
.Ve

For even faster execution, you could do:
.PP

Here's a little program that generates all permutations of
all the words on each line of input. The algorithm embodied
in the \fIpermute()\fR function is discussed in Volume 4 (still
unpublished) of Knuth's \fIThe Art of Computer Programming\fR
and will work on any list:
.PP

Supply a comparison function to \fIsort()\fR (described in \*(L"sort\*(R" in perlfunc):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @list = sort { $a <=> $b } @list;
.Ve
.PP
The default sort function is cmp, string comparison, which would
sort \f(CW\*(C`(1, 2, 10)\*(C'\fR into \f(CW\*(C`(1, 10, 2)\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`<=>\*(C'\fR, used above, is
the numerical comparison operator.
.PP
If you have a complicated function needed to pull out the part you
want to sort on, then don't do it inside the sort function.  Pull it
out first, because the sort \s-1BLOCK\s0 can be called many times for the
same element.  Here's an example of how to pull out the first word
after the first number on each item, and then sort those words
case\-insensitively.
.PP

which could also be written this way, using a trick
that's come to be known as the Schwartzian Transform:
.PP
.Vb 3

\&              sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] }
\&              map  { [ $_, uc( (/\ed+\es*(\eS+)/)[0]) ] } @data;

If you need to sort on several fields, the following paradigm is useful.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    @sorted = sort { field1($a) <=> field1($b) ||
\&                     field2($a) cmp field2($b) ||

This can be conveniently combined with precalculation of keys as given
above.

If you iterate through the hash with \fIeach()\fR, you can delete the key

If your hash could have repeated values, the methods above will only find
one of the associated keys.   This may or may not worry you.  If it does
worry you, you can always reverse the hash into a hash of arrays instead:

To sort a hash, start with the keys. In this example, we give the list of
keys to the sort function which then compares them ASCIIbetically (which
might be affected by your locale settings). The output list has the keys
in ASCIIbetical order. Once we have the keys, we can go through them to
create a report which lists the keys in ASCIIbetical order.

We could get more fancy in the \f(CW\*(C`sort()\*(C'\fR block though. Instead of
comparing the keys, we can compute a value with them and use that
value as the comparison.
.PP
For instance, to make our report order case\-insensitive, we use
the \f(CW\*(C`\eL\*(C'\fR sequence in a double-quoted string to make everything
lowercase. The \f(CW\*(C`sort()\*(C'\fR block then compares the lowercased
values to determine in which order to put the keys.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        my @keys = sort { "\eL$a" cmp "\eL$b" } keys %hash;
.Ve
.PP
Note: if the computation is expensive or the hash has many elements,
you may want to look at the Schwartzian Transform to cache the
computation results.
.PP
If we want to sort by the hash value instead, we use the hash key
to look it up. We still get out a list of keys, but this time they
are ordered by their value.

we can provide a secondary sort on the hash key.

Hashes contain pairs of scalars: the first is the key, the
second is the value.  The key will be coerced to a string,
although the value can be any kind of scalar: string,
number, or reference.  If a key \f(CW$key\fR is present in
\&\f(CW%hash\fR, \f(CW\*(C`exists($hash{$key})\*(C'\fR will return true.  The value
for a given key can be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, in which case
\&\f(CW$hash{$key}\fR will be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR while \f(CW\*(C`exists $hash{$key}\*(C'\fR

.Sh "Why don't my tied hashes make the defined/exists distinction?"
.IX Subsection "Why don't my tied hashes make the defined/exists distinction?"
This depends on the tied hash's implementation of \s-1\fIEXISTS\s0()\fR.
For example, there isn't the concept of undef with hashes
that are tied to DBM* files. It also means that \fIexists()\fR and
\&\fIdefined()\fR do the same thing with a DBM* file, and what they
end up doing is not what they do with ordinary hashes.
.Sh "How do I reset an \fIeach()\fP operation part-way through?"
.IX Subsection "How do I reset an each() operation part-way through?"
Using \f(CW\*(C`keys %hash\*(C'\fR in scalar context returns the number of keys in
the hash \fIand\fR resets the iterator associated with the hash.  You may
need to do this if you use \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR to exit a loop early so that when you
re-enter it, the hash iterator has been reset.
.Sh "How can I get the unique keys from two hashes?"
.IX Subsection "How can I get the unique keys from two hashes?"
First you extract the keys from the hashes into lists, then solve
the \*(L"removing duplicates\*(R" problem described above.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    %seen = ();
\&    for $element (keys(%foo), keys(%bar)) {
\&        $seen{$element}++;
\&    }
\&    @uniq = keys %seen;
.Ve
.PP
Or more succinctly:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @uniq = keys %{{%foo,%bar}};
.Ve
.PP
Or if you really want to save space:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    %seen = ();
\&    while (defined ($key = each %foo)) {
\&        $seen{$key}++;
\&    }
\&    while (defined ($key = each %bar)) {
\&        $seen{$key}++;
\&    }
\&    @uniq = keys %seen;
.Ve
.Sh "How can I store a multidimensional array in a \s-1DBM\s0 file?"
.IX Subsection "How can I store a multidimensional array in a DBM file?"
Either stringify the structure yourself (no fun), or else
get the \s-1MLDBM\s0 (which uses Data::Dumper) module from \s-1CPAN\s0 and layer
it on top of either DB_File or GDBM_File.
.Sh "How can I make my hash remember the order I put elements into it?"
.IX Subsection "How can I make my hash remember the order I put elements into it?"
Use the Tie::IxHash from \s-1CPAN\s0.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    use Tie::IxHash;
\&    tie my %myhash, 'Tie::IxHash';
\&    for (my $i=0; $i<20; $i++) {
\&        $myhash{$i} = 2*$i;
\&    }
\&    my @keys = keys %myhash;
\&    # @keys = (0,1,2,3,...)
.Ve
.Sh "Why does passing a subroutine an undefined element in a hash create it?"
.IX Subsection "Why does passing a subroutine an undefined element in a hash create it?"
If you say something like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    somefunc($hash{"nonesuch key here"});
.Ve
.PP
Then that element \*(L"autovivifies\*(R"; that is, it springs into existence
whether you store something there or not.  That's because functions
get scalars passed in by reference.  If \fIsomefunc()\fR modifies \f(CW$_[0]\fR,
it has to be ready to write it back into the caller's version.
.PP
This has been fixed as of Perl5.004.
.PP
Normally, merely accessing a key's value for a nonexistent key does
\&\fInot\fR cause that key to be forever there.  This is different than
awk's behavior.
.Sh "How can I make the Perl equivalent of a C structure/\*(C+ class/hash or array of hashes or arrays?"

Usually a hash ref, perhaps like this:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    $record = {
\&        NAME   => "Jason",
\&        EMPNO  => 132,
\&        TITLE  => "deputy peon",
\&        AGE    => 23,
\&        SALARY => 37_000,
\&        PALS   => [ "Norbert", "Rhys", "Phineas"],
\&    };
.Ve

References are documented in perlref and the upcoming perlreftut.
Examples of complex data structures are given in perldsc and
perllol.  Examples of structures and object-oriented classes are
in perltoot.
.Sh "How can I use a reference as a hash key?"
.IX Subsection "How can I use a reference as a hash key?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
Hash keys are strings, so you can't really use a reference as the key.
When you try to do that, perl turns the reference into its stringified
form (for instance, \f(CW\*(C`HASH(0xDEADBEEF)\*(C'\fR). From there you can't get back
the reference from the stringified form, at least without doing some
extra work on your own. Also remember that hash keys must be unique, but
two different variables can store the same reference (and those variables
can change later).
.PP
The Tie::RefHash module, which is distributed with perl, might be what
you want. It handles that extra work.
.SH "Data: Misc"

.Sh "How do I handle binary data correctly?"
.IX Subsection "How do I handle binary data correctly?"
Perl is binary clean, so this shouldn't be a problem.  For example,
this works fine (assuming the files are found):
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    if (`cat /vmunix` =~ /gzip/) {
\&        print "Your kernel is GNU-zip enabled!\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
On less elegant (read: Byzantine) systems, however, you have
to play tedious games with \*(L"text\*(R" versus \*(L"binary\*(R" files.  See
\&\*(L"binmode\*(R" in perlfunc or perlopentut.
.PP
If you're concerned about 8\-bit \s-1ASCII\s0 data, then see perllocale.
.PP
If you want to deal with multibyte characters, however, there are
some gotchas.  See the section on Regular Expressions.
.Sh "How do I determine whether a scalar is a number/whole/integer/float?"
.IX Subsection "How do I determine whether a scalar is a number/whole/integer/float?"
Assuming that you don't care about \s-1IEEE\s0 notations like \*(L"NaN\*(R" or
\&\*(L"Infinity\*(R", you probably just want to use a regular expression.
.PP
.Vb 8
\&   if (/\eD/)            { print "has nondigits\en" }
\&   if (/^\ed+$/)         { print "is a whole number\en" }
\&   if (/^-?\ed+$/)       { print "is an integer\en" }
\&   if (/^[+-]?\ed+$/)    { print "is a +/- integer\en" }
\&   if (/^-?\ed+\e.?\ed*$/) { print "is a real number\en" }
\&   if (/^-?(?:\ed+(?:\e.\ed*)?|\e.\ed+)$/) { print "is a decimal number\en" }
\&   if (/^([+-]?)(?=\ed|\e.\ed)\ed*(\e.\ed*)?([Ee]([+-]?\ed+))?$/)
\&                        { print "a C float\en" }
.Ve
.PP
There are also some commonly used modules for the task.
Scalar::Util (distributed with 5.8) provides access to perl's
internal function \f(CW\*(C`looks_like_number\*(C'\fR for determining
whether a variable looks like a number.  Data::Types
exports functions that validate data types using both the
above and other regular expressions. Thirdly, there is
\&\f(CW\*(C`Regexp::Common\*(C'\fR which has regular expressions to match
various types of numbers. Those three modules are available
from the \s-1CPAN\s0.
.PP
If you're on a \s-1POSIX\s0 system, Perl supports the \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::strtod\*(C'\fR
function.  Its semantics are somewhat cumbersome, so here's a \f(CW\*(C`getnum\*(C'\fR
wrapper function for more convenient access.  This function takes
a string and returns the number it found, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for input that
isn't a C float.  The \f(CW\*(C`is_numeric\*(C'\fR function is a front end to \f(CW\*(C`getnum\*(C'\fR
if you just want to say, \*(L"Is this a float?\*(R"
.PP
.Vb 13
\&    sub getnum {
\&        use POSIX qw(strtod);
\&        my $str = shift;
\&        $str =~ s/^\es+//;
\&        $str =~ s/\es+$//;
\&        $! = 0;
\&        my($num, $unparsed) = strtod($str);
\&        if (($str eq '') || ($unparsed != 0) || $!) {
\&            return undef;
\&        } else {
\&            return $num;
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    sub is_numeric { defined getnum($_[0]) }
.Ve
.PP
Or you could check out the String::Scanf module on the \s-1CPAN\s0
instead. The \s-1POSIX\s0 module (part of the standard Perl distribution) provides
the \f(CW\*(C`strtod\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`strtol\*(C'\fR for converting strings to double and longs,
respectively.
.Sh "How do I keep persistent data across program calls?"
.IX Subsection "How do I keep persistent data across program calls?"
For some specific applications, you can use one of the \s-1DBM\s0 modules.
See AnyDBM_File.  More generically, you should consult the FreezeThaw
or Storable modules from \s-1CPAN\s0.  Starting from Perl 5.8 Storable is part
of the standard distribution.  Here's one example using Storable's \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`retrieve\*(C'\fR functions:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Storable;
\&    store(\e%hash, "filename");
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # later on...
\&    $href = retrieve("filename");        # by ref
\&    %hash = %{ retrieve("filename") };   # direct to hash
.Ve
.Sh "How do I print out or copy a recursive data structure?"
.IX Subsection "How do I print out or copy a recursive data structure?"
The Data::Dumper module on \s-1CPAN\s0 (or the 5.005 release of Perl) is great
for printing out data structures.  The Storable module on \s-1CPAN\s0 (or the
5.8 release of Perl), provides a function called \f(CW\*(C`dclone\*(C'\fR that recursively
copies its argument.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Storable qw(dclone);
\&    $r2 = dclone($r1);
.Ve
.PP
Where \f(CW$r1\fR can be a reference to any kind of data structure you'd like.
It will be deeply copied.  Because \f(CW\*(C`dclone\*(C'\fR takes and returns references,
you'd have to add extra punctuation if you had a hash of arrays that
you wanted to copy.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    %newhash = %{ dclone(\e%oldhash) };
.Ve
.Sh "How do I define methods for every class/object?"

Get the Business::CreditCard module from \s-1CPAN\s0.
.Sh "How do I pack arrays of doubles or floats for \s-1XS\s0 code?"
.IX Subsection "How do I pack arrays of doubles or floats for XS code?"
The kgbpack.c code in the \s-1PGPLOT\s0 module on \s-1CPAN\s0 does just this.
If you're doing a lot of float or double processing, consider using
the \s-1PDL\s0 module from \s-1CPAN\s0 instead\*(--it makes number-crunching easy.
