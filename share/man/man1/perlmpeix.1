Updated for perl\-5.8.8 and perl\-5.9.3 by Ken Hirsch.
.Sp
Simplified the build process by using the \s-1MPEAUTOCONF\s0
functionality in Mark Klein's ld.
.Sp
If you build this from scratch, make sure you have a version
of ld which supports it.  In the shell, type
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  ld --help
\&    and look for AUTOCONF or MPEAUTOCONF near the bottom
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  or do this:
\&  ld --help 2>&1 | grep AUTOCONF
.Ve
.Sp
If you see don't see \s-1AUTOCONF\s0 or \s-1MPEAUTOCONF\s0, make sure you get a new
version.
.Sp
You also do not have to use mpeix/relink after building, so the
recommend sequence is:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  ./Configure -de
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&      # or ./Configure -de -Dusedevel 
\&      # if you're building a development version
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  make
\&  make test
\&     # if you run this in a job, do "make test_notty"
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  make install
.Ve
.Sp
Be prepared for a wait. These take much longer on MPE/iX than on a Unix
system, because of a slow forking, mostly.  On a lightly-loaded \s-1HP3000\s0
Series 979 running MPE/iX 7.5:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    Configure: 1 hour
\&    make:      1 hour 15 minutes
\&    make test  1 hour 45 minutes
.Ve
.Sp
Various socket problems were fixed in mpeix.c.

Mark Klein provided a fixed sigsetjmp (that works with dynamic
libraries) in mpeix_setjmp.c

This is the official home page for the \s-1HP\s0 e3000 MPE/iX
( http://www.hp.com/go/e3000 ) port of the Perl scripting
language ( http://www.perl.com/ ) which gives you all of the power of C,
awk, sed, and sh in a single language. Check here for the latest news,
implemented functionality, known bugs, to-do list, etc. Status reports
about major milestones will also be posted to the \s-1HP3000\-L\s0 mailing list
( http://www.lsoft.com/scripts/wl.exe?SL1=HP3000\-L&H=RAVEN.UTC.EDU ) and
its associated gatewayed newsgroup comp.sys.hp.mpe.
.Sp
I'm doing this port because I can't live without Perl on the Unix
machines that I administer, and I want to have the same power
available to me on \s-1MPE\s0.
.Sp
Please send your comments, questions, and bug reports directly to me,
Mark Bixby ( http://www.bixby.org/mark/ ). Or just post them to \s-1HP3000\-L\s0.
.Sp
The platform I'm using to do this port is an \s-1HP\s0 3000 957RX running
MPE/iX 6.0 and using the \s-1GNU\s0 gcc C compiler
( http://jazz.external.hp.com/src/gnu/gnuframe.html ).

MPE/iX Porting Guide (http://www.bixby.org/mark/porting.html).

.SH "MPE/iX Implementation Considerations"
.IX Header "MPE/iX Implementation Considerations"
There some minor functionality issues to be aware of when comparing
Perl for Unix (Perl/UX) to Perl/iX:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1MPE\s0 gcc/ld doesn't properly support linking \s-1NMPRG\s0 executables against
\&\s-1NMXL\s0 dynamic libraries, so you must manually run mpeix/relink after
each re-build of Perl.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Perl/iX File::Copy will use \s-1MPE\s0's /bin/cp command to copy files by
name in order to preserve file attributes like file code.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1MPE\s0 (and thus Perl/iX) lacks support for \fIsetgrent()\fR, \fIendgrent()\fR,
\&\fIsetpwent()\fR, \fIendpwent()\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1MPE\s0 (and thus Perl/iX) lacks support for hard links.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1MPE\s0 requires \s-1\fIGETPRIVMODE\s0()\fR in order to \fIbind()\fR to ports less than 1024.
Perl/iX will call \s-1\fIGETPRIVMODE\s0()\fR automatically on your behalf if you
attempt to \fIbind()\fR to these low-numbered ports.  Note that the Perl/iX
executable and the \s-1PERL\s0 account do not normally have CAP=PM, so if you
will be \fIbind()\fR\-ing to these privileged ports, you will manually need
to add \s-1PM\s0 capability as appropriate.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1MPE\s0 requires that you \fIbind()\fR to an \s-1IP\s0 address of zero.  Perl/iX
automatically replaces the \s-1IP\s0 address that you pass to \fIbind()\fR with
a zero.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1MPE\s0 requires \s-1\fIGETPRIVMODE\s0()\fR in order to \fIsetuid()\fR.  There are too many

Updated to version 5.004_70 (internal developer release) which is now
MPE\-ready.  The next public freeware release of Perl should compile
\&\*(L"straight out of the box\*(R" on \s-1MPE\s0.  Note that this version of Perl/iX
was strictly internal to me and never publicly released.  Note that
[21]BIND/iX is now required (well, the include files and libbind.a) if
you wish to compile Perl/iX.
