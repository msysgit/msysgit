.IX Title "PERLDIAG 1"
.TH PERLDIAG 1 "2006-01-07" "perl v5.8.8" "Perl Programmers Reference Guide"
.SH "NAME"
perldiag \- various Perl diagnostics
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    (W) A warning (optional).
\&    (D) A deprecation (optional).
\&    (S) A severe warning (default).
\&    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
\&    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
\&    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
\&    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
.Ve
.PP
The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D & S) can be controlled using the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma.
.PP
If a message can be controlled by the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.
.PP
Optional warnings are enabled by using the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma or the \fB\-w\fR
and \fB\-W\fR switches. Warnings may be captured by setting \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR
to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See perlvar.
.PP
Default warnings are always enabled unless they are explicitly disabled
with the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma or the \fB\-X\fR switch.
.PP
Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
\&\*(L"eval\*(R" in perlfunc.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma.
See warnings.
.PP
The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower\-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a \f(CW%s\fR or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.
.ie n .IP "\fIaccept()\fR on closed socket %s" 4
.el .IP "\fIaccept()\fR on closed socket \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "accept() on closed socket %s"
(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your \fIsocket()\fR call?  See
\&\*(L"accept\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Allocation too large: %lx" 4
.el .IP "Allocation too large: \f(CW%lx\fR" 4
.IX Item "Allocation too large: %lx"
(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.
.ie n .IP "'!' allowed only after types %s" 4
.el .IP "'!' allowed only after types \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "'!' allowed only after types %s"
(F) The '!' is allowed in \fIpack()\fR or \fIunpack()\fR only after certain types.
See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &"
(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.
.Sp
To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the \f(CW\*(C`use subs\*(C'\fR pragma).
.Sp
To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the \f(CW\*(C`CORE::\*(C'\fR prefix
on the operator (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`CORE::log($x)\*(C'\fR) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see \*(L"Subroutine Attributes\*(R" in perlsub or
attributes).
.IP "Ambiguous range in transliteration operator" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous range in transliteration operator"
(F) You wrote something like \f(CW\*(C`tr/a\-z\-0//\*(C'\fR which doesn't mean anything at
all.  To include a \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last.  (In the past, \f(CW\*(C`tr/a\-z\-0//\*(C'\fR was synonymous with
\&\f(CW\*(C`tr/a\-y//\*(C'\fR, which was probably not what you would have expected.)
.ie n .IP "Ambiguous use of %s\fR resolved as \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "Ambiguous use of \f(CW%s\fR resolved as \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s"
(W ambiguous)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.
.IP "'|' and '<' may not both be specified on command line" 4
.IX Item "'|' and '<' may not both be specified on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that \s-1STDIN\s0 was a pipe, and that you also tried to
redirect \s-1STDIN\s0 using '<'.  Only one \s-1STDIN\s0 stream to a customer, please.
.IP "'|' and '>' may not both be specified on command line" 4
.IX Item "'|' and '>' may not both be specified on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and
into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other,
though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script
which 'splits' output into two streams, such as
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    open(OUT,">$ARGV[0]") or die "Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!";
\&    while (<STDIN>) {
\&        print;
\&        print OUT;
\&    }
\&    close OUT;
.Ve
.ie n .IP "Applying %s\fR to \f(CW%s will act on scalar(%s)" 4
.el .IP "Applying \f(CW%s\fR to \f(CW%s\fR will act on scalar(%s)" 4
.IX Item "Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)"
(W misc) The pattern match (\f(CW\*(C`//\*(C'\fR), substitution (\f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR), and
transliteration (\f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value \*(-- the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash \*(-- and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See \*(L"grep\*(R" in perlfunc and \*(L"map\*(R" in perlfunc for
alternatives.
.IP "Args must match #! line" 4
.IX Item "Args must match #! line"
(F) The setuid emulator requires that the arguments Perl was invoked
with match the arguments specified on the #! line.  Since some systems
impose a one-argument limit on the #! line, try combining switches;
for example, turn \f(CW\*(C`\-w \-U\*(C'\fR into \f(CW\*(C`\-wU\*(C'\fR.
.IP "Arg too short for msgsnd" 4
.IX Item "Arg too short for msgsnd"
(F) \fImsgsnd()\fR requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).
.IP "%s argument is not a \s-1HASH\s0 or \s-1ARRAY\s0 element" 4
.IX Item "%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element"
(F) The argument to \fIexists()\fR must be a hash or array element, such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $foo{$bar}
\&    $ref->{"susie"}[12]
.Ve
.IP "%s argument is not a \s-1HASH\s0 or \s-1ARRAY\s0 element or slice" 4
.IX Item "%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice"
(F) The argument to \fIdelete()\fR must be either a hash or array element,
such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $foo{$bar}
\&    $ref->{"susie"}[12]
.Ve
.Sp
or a hash or array slice, such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
\&    @{$ref->[12]}{"susie", "queue"}
.Ve
.IP "%s argument is not a subroutine name" 4
.IX Item "%s argument is not a subroutine name"
(F) The argument to \fIexists()\fR for \f(CW\*(C`exists &sub\*(C'\fR must be a subroutine
name, and not a subroutine call.  \f(CW\*(C`exists &sub()\*(C'\fR will generate this
error.
.ie n .IP "Argument ""%s"" isn't numeric%s" 4
.el .IP "Argument ``%s'' isn't numeric%s" 4
.IX Item "Argument %s isn't numeric%s"
(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
.ie n .IP "Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer %s"
(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you
forgot the ) that closes the argument list.  (Layers take care of transforming
data between external and internal representations.)  Perl stopped parsing
the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer.
If your program didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be
the result of the value of the environment variable \s-1PERLIO\s0.
.ie n .IP "Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()" 4
.el .IP "Array @%s missing the @ in argument \f(CW%d\fR of %s()" 4
.IX Item "Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()"
(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.
.ie n .IP "assertion botched: %s" 4
.el .IP "assertion botched: \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "assertion botched: %s"
(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
.ie n .IP "Assertion failed: file ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "Assertion failed: file ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "Assertion failed: file %s"
(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.
.IP "Assignment to both a list and a scalar" 4
.IX Item "Assignment to both a list and a scalar"
(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.
.ie n .IP "A thread exited while %d threads were running" 4
.el .IP "A thread exited while \f(CW%d\fR threads were running" 4
.IX Item "A thread exited while %d threads were running"
(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily the main
thread) exited while there were still other threads running.
Usually it's a good idea to first collect the return values of the
created threads by joining them, and only then exit from the main
thread.  See threads.
.IP "Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash"
(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in
the current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.
.IP "Attempt to bless into a reference" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to bless into a reference"
(F) The \s-1CLASSNAME\s0 argument to the \fIbless()\fR operator is expected to be
the name of the package to bless the resulting object into. You've
supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    bless $self, $proto;
.Ve
.Sp
when you intended
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;
.Ve
.Sp
If you actually want to bless into the stringified version
of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for
example by:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    bless $self, "$proto";
.Ve
.IP "Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash"
(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key
which is not in its key set.
.IP "Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash"
(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been
declared readonly from a restricted hash.
.IP "Attempt to free non-arena \s-1SV:\s0 0x%lx" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%lx"
(P internal) All \s-1SV\s0 objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An \s-1SV\s0 was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.
.IP "Attempt to free nonexistent shared string" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free nonexistent shared string"
(P internal) Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count
of a string that can no longer be found in the table.
.IP "Attempt to free temp prematurely" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free temp prematurely"
(W debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
\&\fIfree_tmps()\fR routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
\&\s-1SV\s0 before the \fIfree_tmps()\fR routine gets a chance, which means that the
\&\fIfree_tmps()\fR routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.
.IP "Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers"
(P internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.
.IP "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar"
(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that \fISvREFCNT_dec()\fR was called too many times, or
that \fISvREFCNT_inc()\fR was called too few times, or that the \s-1SV\s0 was
mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
corrupted.
.IP "Attempt to join self" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to join self"
(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an
impossible task.  You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need
to move the \fIjoin()\fR to some other thread.
.IP "Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value"
(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the \*(L"p\*(R" \fIpack()\fR template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the \*(L"p\*(R" \fIpack()\fR template to
avoid this warning.
.IP "Attempt to set length of freed array" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to set length of freed array"
(W) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed.  You
can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last index
of an array and later assigning through that reference. For example
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $r = do {my @a; \e$#a};
\&    $$r = 503
.Ve
.IP "Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr" 4
.IX Item "Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr"
(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to \fIsubstr()\fR
used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See \*(L"substr\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Bad arg length for %s\fR, is \f(CW%d\fR, should be \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "Bad arg length for \f(CW%s\fR, is \f(CW%d\fR, should be \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Bad arg length for %s, is %d, should be %s"
(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of \fImsgctl()\fR, \fIsemctl()\fR
or \fIshmctl()\fR.  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
sizeof(struct\ msqid_ds\ *), sizeof(struct\ semid_ds\ *), and
sizeof(struct\ shmid_ds\ *).
.IP "Bad evalled substitution pattern" 4
.IX Item "Bad evalled substitution pattern"
(F) You've used the \f(CW\*(C`/e\*(C'\fR switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate,
most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.
.ie n .IP "Bad filehandle: %s" 4
.el .IP "Bad filehandle: \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Bad filehandle: %s"
(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the
symbol has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an
\&\fIopen()\fR, or did it in another package.
.IP "Bad \fIfree()\fR ignored" 4
.IX Item "Bad free() ignored"
(S malloc) An internal routine called \fIfree()\fR on something that had never
been \fImalloc()\fRed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PERL_BADFREE\*(C'\fR to 0.
.Sp
This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with \*(L"hard\*(R"
dynamic linking, like \f(CW\*(C`AIX\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`OS/2\*(C'\fR. It is a bug of \f(CW\*(C`Berkeley DB\*(C'\fR
which is left unnoticed if \f(CW\*(C`DB\*(C'\fR uses \fIforgiving\fR system \fImalloc()\fR.
.IP "Bad hash" 4
.IX Item "Bad hash"
(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null \s-1HV\s0 pointer.
.IP "Bad index while coercing array into hash" 4
.IX Item "Bad index while coercing array into hash"
(F) The index looked up in the hash found as the 0'th element of a
pseudo-hash is not legal.  Index values must be at 1 or greater.
See perlref.
.IP "Badly placed ()'s" 4
.IX Item "Badly placed ()'s"
(A) You've accidentally run your script through \fBcsh\fR instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.
.ie n .IP "Bad name after %s::" 4
.el .IP "Bad name after \f(CW%s::\fR" 4
.IX Item "Bad name after %s::"
(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
didn't finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside
of quotes, so
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $var = 'myvar';
\&    $sym = mypack::$var;
.Ve
.Sp
is not the same as
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $var = 'myvar';
\&    $sym = "mypack::$var";
.Ve
.IP "Bad \fIrealloc()\fR ignored" 4
.IX Item "Bad realloc() ignored"
(S malloc) An internal routine called \fIrealloc()\fR on something that had
never been \fImalloc()\fRed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled
by setting environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PERL_BADFREE\*(C'\fR to 1.
.IP "Bad symbol for array" 4
.IX Item "Bad symbol for array"
(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
.IP "Bad symbol for filehandle" 4
.IX Item "Bad symbol for filehandle"
(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something
that wasn't a symbol table entry.
.IP "Bad symbol for hash" 4
.IX Item "Bad symbol for hash"
(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
.IP "Bareword found in conditional" 4
.IX Item "Bareword found in conditional"
(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or && was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    open FOO || die;
.Ve
.Sp
It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:
.Sp

.IX Item "Bareword %s not allowed while strict subs in use"
(F) With \*(L"strict subs\*(R" in use, a bareword is only allowed as a

(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form \f(CW\*(C`Foo::\*(C'\fR, but the

(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a \s-1BEGIN\s0
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.
.IP "\s-1BEGIN\s0 not safe after errors\*(--compilation aborted" 4
.IX Item "BEGIN not safe after errorscompilation aborted"
(F) Perl found a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN {}\*(C'\fR subroutine (or a \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR directive, which
implies a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN {}\*(C'\fR) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN {}\*(C'\fR could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.

(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.

.IP "%s() called too early to check prototype" 4
.IX Item "%s() called too early to check prototype"
(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an
early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype
checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the
function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning.  See perlsub.

.IX Item "Cannot compress integer in pack"
(F) An argument to pack(\*(L"w\*(R",...) was too large to compress.  The \s-1BER\s0

.IX Item "Can't do seteuid!"
(P) The setuid emulator of suidperl failed for some reason.
.IP "Can't do setuid" 4
.IX Item "Can't do setuid"
(F) This typically means that ordinary perl tried to exec suidperl to do
setuid emulation, but couldn't exec it.  It looks for a name of the form
sperl5.000 in the same directory that the perl executable resides under
the name perl5.000, typically /usr/local/bin on Unix machines.  If the

.IX Item "Can't fork"
(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a
pipeline.
.IP "Can't get filespec \- stale stat buffer?" 4
.IX Item "Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?"
(S) A warning peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under \s-1VMS\s0 and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under \s-1VMS\s0, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and \s-1FID\s0 present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the \s-1CRTL\s0 \fIstat()\fR routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up
and returned \s-1FALSE\s0, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access checking
routine knows about the Perl \f(CW\*(C`stat\*(C'\fR operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)
.IP "Can't get pipe mailbox device name" 4
.IX Item "Can't get pipe mailbox device name"
(P) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  After creating a mailbox to act as a

(F) A \*(L"goto\*(R" statement was executed to jump out of what might look like
a block, except that it isn't a proper block.  This usually occurs if
you tried to jump out of a \fIsort()\fR block or subroutine, which is a no\-no.

.IX Item "Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine"
(F) The deeply magical \*(L"goto subroutine\*(R" call can only replace one
subroutine call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole
cloth.  In general you should be calling it out of only an \s-1AUTOLOAD\s0

.IP "Can't ignore signal \s-1CHLD\s0, forcing to default" 4
.IX Item "Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default"
(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the \s-1SIGCHLD\s0
signal (sometimes known as \s-1SIGCLD\s0) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This
situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.

.IX Item "Can't last outside a loop block"
(F) A \*(L"last\*(R" statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current

block, as doesn't a block given to \fIsort()\fR, \fImap()\fR or \fIgrep()\fR.  You can
usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the

.IX Item "Can't load '%s' for module %s"
(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension. This
may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is
incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known to happen
between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your dynamic

found. Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in \f(CW@INC\fR,
unless the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you
need to set the \s-1PERL5LIB\s0 or \s-1PERL5OPT\s0 environment variable to say where
the extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name
to \f(CW@INC\fR.  Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See

(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.
.Sp
If you're debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the

you don't have to type the path or \f(CW`which $scriptname`\fR.
.IP "Can't read \s-1CRTL\s0 environ" 4
.IX Item "Can't read CRTL environ"
(S) A warning peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl tried to read an element of \f(CW%ENV\fR
from the \s-1CRTL\s0's internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your \s-1CRTL\s0 misplaced its environ
or define \fI\s-1PERL_ENV_TABLES\s0\fR (see perlvms) so that environ is not
searched.
.ie n .IP "Can't redefine active sort subroutine %s" 4
.el .IP "Can't redefine active sort subroutine \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Can't redefine active sort subroutine %s"
(F) Perl optimizes the internal handling of sort subroutines and keeps
pointers into them.  You tried to redefine one such sort subroutine when
it was currently active, which is not allowed.  If you really want to do
this, you should write \f(CW\*(C`sort { &func } @x\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`sort func @x\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP "Can't ""redo"" outside a loop block" 4

.IX Item "Can't redo outside a loop block"
(F) A \*(L"redo\*(R" statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an \*(L"if\*(R" or \*(L"else\*(R" block doesn't
count as a \*(L"loopish\*(R" block, as doesn't a block given to \fIsort()\fR, \fImap()\fR

.IX Item "Can't resolve method `%s' overloading `%s' in package `%s'"
(F|P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as opposed

(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as
temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.  This
is not allowed.
.IP "Can't return outside a subroutine" 4
.IX Item "Can't return outside a subroutine"
(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See perlsub.

.el .IP "Can't return \f(CW%s\fR to lvalue scalar context" 4
.IX Item "Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context"
(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue subroutine,
but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think you meant
to return only one value. You probably meant to write parentheses around
the call to the subroutine, which tell Perl that the call should be in
list context.

.IX Item "Can't undef active subroutine"
(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the

.IX Item "Can't upgrade that kind of scalar"
(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds \*(L"members\*(R" to an \s-1SV\s0, making it
into a more specialized kind of \s-1SV\s0.  The top several \s-1SV\s0 types are so
specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.
.IP "Can't upgrade to undef" 4
.IX Item "Can't upgrade to undef"
(P) The undefined \s-1SV\s0 is the bottom of the totem pole, in the scheme of
upgradability.  Upgrading to undef indicates an error in the code
calling sv_upgrade.
.IP "Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup" 4
.IX Item "Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup"
(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol
table that doesn't have a name.  Symbol tables can become anonymous
for example by undefining stashes: \f(CW\*(C`undef %Some::Package::\*(C'\fR.

.IX Item "Can't use global %s in my"
(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This
is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location
(namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.

(F) The global variables \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned \f(CW$a\fR or \f(CW$b\fR in the same line as the <=> or cmp operator,

.IP "Can't use \e%c to mean $%c in expression" 4
.IX Item "Can't use %c to mean $%c in expression"
(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a
backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like \s-1\fISCALAR\s0\fR\|(0xdecaf).  Use the \f(CW$1\fR form
instead.

.IX Item "Can't x= to read-only value"
(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value)

.IX Item "corrupted regexp pointers"
(P) The regular expression engine got confused by what the regular
expression compiler gave it.
.IP "corrupted regexp program" 4
.IX Item "corrupted regexp program"
(P) The regular expression engine got passed a regexp program without a
valid magic number.
.IP "Corrupt malloc ptr 0x%lx at 0x%lx" 4
.IX Item "Corrupt malloc ptr 0x%lx at 0x%lx"
(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
.IP "Count after length/code in unpack" 4
.IX Item "Count after length/code in unpack"
(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string, but
you have also specified an explicit size for the string.  See
\&\*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Deep recursion on subroutine ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "Deep recursion on subroutine ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "Deep recursion on subroutine %s"
(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly)
100 times more than it has returned.  This probably indicates an
infinite recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in
which case it indicates something else.
.IP "defined(@array) is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "defined(@array) is deprecated"
(D deprecated) \fIdefined()\fR is not usually useful on arrays because it
checks for an undefined \fIscalar\fR value.  If you want to see if the
array is empty, just use \f(CW\*(C`if (@array) { # not empty }\*(C'\fR for example.
.IP "defined(%hash) is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "defined(%hash) is deprecated"
(D deprecated) \fIdefined()\fR is not usually useful on hashes because it
checks for an undefined \fIscalar\fR value.  If you want to see if the hash
is empty, just use \f(CW\*(C`if (%hash) { # not empty }\*(C'\fR for example.
.IP "%s defines neither package nor VERSION\*(--version check failed" 4
.IX Item "%s defines neither package nor VERSIONversion check failed"
(F) You said something like \*(L"use Module 42\*(R" but in the Module file
there are neither package declarations nor a \f(CW$VERSION\fR.
.IP "Delimiter for here document is too long" 4
.IX Item "Delimiter for here document is too long"
(F) In a here document construct like \f(CW\*(C`<<FOO\*(C'\fR, the label \f(CW\*(C`FOO\*(C'\fR is too
long for Perl to handle.  You have to be seriously twisted to write code
that triggers this error.
.IP "\s-1DESTROY\s0 created new reference to dead object '%s'" 4
.IX Item "DESTROY created new reference to dead object '%s'"
(F) A \s-1\fIDESTROY\s0()\fR method created a new reference to the object which is
just being DESTROYed. Perl is confused, and prefers to abort rather than
to create a dangling reference.
.IP "Did not produce a valid header" 4
.IX Item "Did not produce a valid header"
See Server error.
.IP "%s did not return a true value" 4
.IX Item "%s did not return a true value"
(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a \*(L"1;\*(R", though any true value would
do.  See \*(L"require\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "(Did you mean &%s instead?)" 4
.IX Item "(Did you mean &%s instead?)"
(W) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &FOO as \f(CW$FOO\fR or some
such.
.ie n .IP "(Did you mean ""local"" instead of ""our""?)" 4
.el .IP "(Did you mean ``local'' instead of ``our''?)" 4
.IX Item "(Did you mean local instead of our?)"
(W misc) Remember that \*(L"our\*(R" does not localize the declared global
variable.  You have declared it again in the same lexical scope, which
seems superfluous.
.IP "(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)" 4
.IX Item "(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)"
(W) You probably said \f(CW%hash\fR{$key} when you meant \f(CW$hash\fR{$key} or
\&\f(CW@hash\fR{@keys}.  On the other hand, maybe you just meant \f(CW%hash\fR and got
carried away.
.IP "Died" 4
.IX Item "Died"
(F) You passed \fIdie()\fR an empty string (the equivalent of \f(CW\*(C`die ""\*(C'\fR) or
you called it with no args and both \f(CW$@\fR and \f(CW$_\fR were empty.
.IP "Document contains no data" 4
.IX Item "Document contains no data"
See Server error.
.ie n .IP "%s does not define %s::VERSION\*(--version check failed" 4
.el .IP "%s does not define \f(CW%s::VERSION\fR\*(--version check failed" 4
.IX Item "%s does not define %s::VERSIONversion check failed"
(F) You said something like \*(L"use Module 42\*(R" but the Module did not
define a \f(CW\*(C`$VERSION.\*(C'\fR
.IP "'/' does not take a repeat count" 4
.IX Item "'/' does not take a repeat count"
(F) You cannot put a repeat count of any kind right after the '/' code.
See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'" 4
.IX Item "Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'"
(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.
.IP "do_study: out of memory" 4
.IX Item "do_study: out of memory"
(P) This should have been caught by \fIsafemalloc()\fR instead.
.ie n .IP "(Do you need to predeclare %s?)" 4
.el .IP "(Do you need to predeclare \f(CW%s\fR?)" 4
.IX Item "(Do you need to predeclare %s?)"
(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
\&\*(L"%s found where operator expected\*(R".  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
\&\*(L"sub\*(R", \*(L"package\*(R", \*(L"require\*(R", or \*(L"use\*(R" statement.  If you're referencing
something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have to define the
subroutine or package before the current location.  You can use an empty
\&\*(L"sub foo;\*(R" or \*(L"package \s-1FOO\s0;\*(R" to enter a \*(L"forward\*(R" declaration.
.IP "\fIdump()\fR better written as \fICORE::dump()\fR" 4
.IX Item "dump() better written as CORE::dump()"
(W misc) You used the obsolescent \f(CW\*(C`dump()\*(C'\fR built-in function, without fully
qualifying it as \f(CW\*(C`CORE::dump()\*(C'\fR.  Maybe it's a typo.  See \*(L"dump\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Duplicate \fIfree()\fR ignored" 4
.IX Item "Duplicate free() ignored"
(S malloc) An internal routine called \fIfree()\fR on something that had
already been freed.
.ie n .IP "Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in %s" 4
.el .IP "Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in %s"
(W) You have applied the same modifier more than once after a type
in a pack template.  See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "elseif should be elsif" 4
.IX Item "elseif should be elsif"
(S syntax) There is no keyword \*(L"elseif\*(R" in Perl because Larry thinks it's
ugly. Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method named
\&\*(L"elseif\*(R" for the class returned by the following block.  This is
unlikely to be what you want.
.ie n .IP "Empty %s" 4
.el .IP "Empty \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Empty %s"
(F) \f(CW\*(C`\ep\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP\*(C'\fR are used to introduce a named Unicode property, as
described in perlunicode and perlre. You used \f(CW\*(C`\ep\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\eP\*(C'\fR in
a regular expression without specifying the property name.
.ie n .IP "entering effective %s failed" 4
.el .IP "entering effective \f(CW%s\fR failed" 4
.IX Item "entering effective %s failed"
(F) While under the \f(CW\*(C`use filetest\*(C'\fR pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.
.ie n .IP "%ENV is aliased to %s" 4
.el .IP "%ENV is aliased to \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "%ENV is aliased to %s"
(F) You're running under taint mode, and the \f(CW%ENV\fR variable has been
aliased to another hash, so it doesn't reflect anymore the state of the
program's environment. This is potentially insecure.
.ie n .IP "Error converting file specification %s" 4
.el .IP "Error converting file specification \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Error converting file specification %s"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either \s-1VMS\s0 or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've passed
an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the
conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.
.IP "%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression" 4
.IX Item "%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression"
(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular
expression that contains the \f(CW\*(C`(?{ ... })\*(C'\fR zero-width assertion, which
is unsafe.  See \*(L"(?{ code })\*(R" in perlre, and perlsec.
.IP "%s: Eval-group not allowed at run time" 4
.IX Item "%s: Eval-group not allowed at run time"
(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the
\&\f(CW\*(C`(?{ ... })\*(C'\fR zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk, it
is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by explicitly
building the pattern from an interpolated string at run time and using
that in an \fIeval()\fR.  See \*(L"(?{ code })\*(R" in perlre.
.IP "%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'" 4
.IX Item "%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'"
(F) A regular expression contained the \f(CW\*(C`(?{ ... })\*(C'\fR zero-width
assertion, but that construct is only allowed when the \f(CW\*(C`use re 'eval'\*(C'\fR
pragma is in effect.  See \*(L"(?{ code })\*(R" in perlre.
.IP "Excessively long <> operator" 4
.IX Item "Excessively long <> operator"
(F) The contents of a <> operator may not exceed the maximum size of a
Perl identifier.  If you're just trying to glob a long list of
filenames, try using the \fIglob()\fR operator, or put the filenames into a
variable and glob that.
.IP "exec? I'm not *that* kind of operating system" 4
.IX Item "exec? I'm not *that* kind of operating system"
(F) The \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR function is not implemented in MacPerl. See perlport.
.ie n .IP "Execution of %s aborted due to compilation errors" 4
.el .IP "Execution of \f(CW%s\fR aborted due to compilation errors" 4
.IX Item "Execution of %s aborted due to compilation errors"
(F) The final summary message when a Perl compilation fails.
.ie n .IP "Exiting eval via %s" 4
.el .IP "Exiting eval via \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Exiting eval via %s"
(W exiting) You are exiting an eval by unconventional means, such as a
goto, or a loop control statement.
.ie n .IP "Exiting format via %s" 4
.el .IP "Exiting format via \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Exiting format via %s"
(W exiting) You are exiting a format by unconventional means, such as a
goto, or a loop control statement.
.ie n .IP "Exiting pseudo-block via %s" 4
.el .IP "Exiting pseudo-block via \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Exiting pseudo-block via %s"
(W exiting) You are exiting a rather special block construct (like a
sort block or subroutine) by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a
loop control statement.  See \*(L"sort\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Exiting subroutine via %s" 4
.el .IP "Exiting subroutine via \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Exiting subroutine via %s"
(W exiting) You are exiting a subroutine by unconventional means, such
as a goto, or a loop control statement.
.ie n .IP "Exiting substitution via %s" 4
.el .IP "Exiting substitution via \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Exiting substitution via %s"
(W exiting) You are exiting a substitution by unconventional means, such
as a return, a goto, or a loop control statement.
.IP "Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)" 4
.IX Item "Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)"
(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.  This has
the effect of blessing the reference into the package main.  This is
usually not what you want.  Consider providing a default target package,
e.g. bless($ref, \f(CW$p\fR || 'MyPackage');
.IP "%s: Expression syntax" 4
.IX Item "%s: Expression syntax"
(A) You've accidentally run your script through \fBcsh\fR instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.
.IP "%s failed\*(--call queue aborted" 4
.IX Item "%s failedcall queue aborted"
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a \s-1CHECK\s0, \s-1INIT\s0, or
\&\s-1END\s0 subroutine.  Processing of the remainder of the queue of such
routines has been prematurely ended.
.ie n .IP "False [] range ""%s"" in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.el .IP "False [] range ``%s'' in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "False [] range %s in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal
character, not another character class like \f(CW\*(C`\ed\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`[:alpha:]\*(C'\fR.  The \*(L"\-\*(R"
in your false range is interpreted as a literal \*(L"\-\*(R".  Consider quoting the
\&\*(L"\-\*(R", \*(L"\e\-\*(R".  The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows in the regular expression about where the
problem was discovered.  See perlre.
.ie n .IP "Fatal \s-1VMS\s0 error at %s\fR, line \f(CW%d" 4
.el .IP "Fatal \s-1VMS\s0 error at \f(CW%s\fR, line \f(CW%d\fR" 4
.IX Item "Fatal VMS error at %s, line %d"
(P) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Something untoward happened in a \s-1VMS\s0
system service or \s-1RTL\s0 routine; Perl's exit status should provide more
details.  The filename in \*(L"at \f(CW%s\fR\*(R" and the line number in \*(L"line \f(CW%d\fR\*(R" tell
you which section of the Perl source code is distressed.
.IP "fcntl is not implemented" 4
.IX Item "fcntl is not implemented"
(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement \fIfcntl()\fR.  What is this, a
\&\s-1PDP\-11\s0 or something?
.ie n .IP "Filehandle %s opened only for input" 4
.el .IP "Filehandle \f(CW%s\fR opened only for input" 4
.IX Item "Filehandle %s opened only for input"
(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you intended
it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with \*(L"+<\*(R" or
\&\*(L"+>\*(R" or \*(L"+>>\*(R" instead of with \*(L"<\*(R" or nothing.  If you intended only to
write the file, use \*(L">\*(R" or \*(L">>\*(R".  See \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Filehandle %s opened only for output" 4
.el .IP "Filehandle \f(CW%s\fR opened only for output" 4
.IX Item "Filehandle %s opened only for output"
(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If
you intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it
with \*(L"+<\*(R" or \*(L"+>\*(R" or \*(L"+>>\*(R" instead of with \*(L"<\*(R" or nothing.  If you
intended only to read from the file, use \*(L"<\*(R".  See \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc.
Another possibility is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0
(also known as \s-1STDIN\s0) for output (maybe you closed \s-1STDIN\s0 earlier?).
.ie n .IP "Filehandle %s\fR reopened as \f(CW%s only for input" 4
.el .IP "Filehandle \f(CW%s\fR reopened as \f(CW%s\fR only for input" 4
.IX Item "Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input"
(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as \s-1STDOUT\s0 or \s-1STDERR\s0. This occurred because you closed \s-1STDOUT\s0 or \s-1STDERR\s0
previously.
.ie n .IP "Filehandle \s-1STDIN\s0 reopened as %s only for output" 4
.el .IP "Filehandle \s-1STDIN\s0 reopened as \f(CW%s\fR only for output" 4
.IX Item "Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s only for output"
(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as \s-1STDIN\s0. This occurred because you closed \s-1STDIN\s0 previously.
.ie n .IP "Final $ should be \e$ or $name" 4
.el .IP "Final $ should be \e$ or \f(CW$name\fR" 4
.IX Item "Final $ should be $ or $name"
(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or the
name.
.ie n .IP "\fIflock()\fR on closed filehandle %s" 4
.el .IP "\fIflock()\fR on closed filehandle \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "flock() on closed filehandle %s"
(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to \fIflock()\fR got itself closed
some time before now.  Check your control flow.  \fIflock()\fR operates on
filehandles.  Are you attempting to call \fIflock()\fR on a dirhandle by the
same name?
.IP "Format not terminated" 4
.IX Item "Format not terminated"
(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot.  Perl got
to the end of your file without finding such a line.
.ie n .IP "Format %s redefined" 4
.el .IP "Format \f(CW%s\fR redefined" 4
.IX Item "Format %s redefined"
(W redefine) You redefined a format.  To suppress this warning, say
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    {
\&        no warnings 'redefine';
\&        eval "format NAME =...";
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "Found = in conditional, should be ==" 4
.IX Item "Found = in conditional, should be =="
(W syntax) You said
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ($foo = 123)
.Ve
.Sp
when you meant
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ($foo == 123)
.Ve
.Sp
(or something like that).
.IP "%s found where operator expected" 4
.IX Item "%s found where operator expected"
(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an
operator, it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.
.ie n .IP "gdbm store returned %d\fR, errno \f(CW%d, key ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "gdbm store returned \f(CW%d\fR, errno \f(CW%d\fR, key ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key %s"
(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.
.IP "gethostent not implemented" 4
.IX Item "gethostent not implemented"
(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement \fIgethostent()\fR, probably
because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every hostname
on the Internet.
.ie n .IP "get%\fIsname()\fR on closed socket %s" 4
.el .IP "get%\fIsname()\fR on closed socket \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "get%sname() on closed socket %s"
(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed
socket.  Did you forget to check the return value of your \fIsocket()\fR call?
.ie n .IP "getpwnam returned invalid \s-1UIC\s0 %#o for user ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "getpwnam returned invalid \s-1UIC\s0 %#o for user ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user %s"
(S) A warning peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  The call to \f(CW\*(C`sys$getuai\*(C'\fR underlying the
\&\f(CW\*(C`getpwnam\*(C'\fR operator returned an invalid \s-1UIC\s0.
.ie n .IP "\fIgetsockopt()\fR on closed socket %s" 4
.el .IP "\fIgetsockopt()\fR on closed socket \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "getsockopt() on closed socket %s"
(W closed) You tried to get a socket option on a closed socket.  Did you
forget to check the return value of your \fIsocket()\fR call?  See
\&\*(L"getsockopt\*(R" in perlfunc.
.ie n .IP "Global symbol ""%s"" requires explicit package name" 4
.el .IP "Global symbol ``%s'' requires explicit package name" 4
.IX Item "Global symbol %s requires explicit package name"
(F) You've said \*(L"use strict vars\*(R", which indicates that all variables
must either be lexically scoped (using \*(L"my\*(R"), declared beforehand using
\&\*(L"our\*(R", or explicitly qualified to say which package the global variable
is in (using \*(L"::\*(R").
.IP "glob failed (%s)" 4
.IX Item "glob failed (%s)"
(W glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used for
\&\f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`<*.c>\*(C'\fR.  Usually, this means that you supplied a
\&\f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a
nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit
resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables in
config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as if it
were csh (e.g.  \f(CW\*(C`full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'\*(C'\fR); otherwise, make them all
empty (except that \f(CW\*(C`d_csh\*(C'\fR should be \f(CW'undef'\fR) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
\&\f(CW\*(C`./Configure \-S\*(C'\fR and rebuild Perl.
.IP "Glob not terminated" 4
.IX Item "Glob not terminated"
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a \*(L"less than\*(R".
.IP "Got an error from DosAllocMem" 4
.IX Item "Got an error from DosAllocMem"
(P) An error peculiar to \s-1OS/2\s0.  Most probably you're using an obsolete
version of Perl, and this should not happen anyway.
.IP "goto must have label" 4
.IX Item "goto must have label"
(F) Unlike with \*(L"next\*(R" or \*(L"last\*(R", you're not allowed to goto an
unspecified destination.  See \*(L"goto\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "()\-group starts with a count" 4
.IX Item "()-group starts with a count"
(F) A ()\-group started with a count.  A count is
supposed to follow something: a template character or a ()\-group.
 See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "%s had compilation errors" 4
.IX Item "%s had compilation errors"
(F) The final summary message when a \f(CW\*(C`perl \-c\*(C'\fR fails.
.ie n .IP "Had to create %s unexpectedly" 4
.el .IP "Had to create \f(CW%s\fR unexpectedly" 4
.IX Item "Had to create %s unexpectedly"
(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought
to have existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be
created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.
.ie n .IP "Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()" 4
.el .IP "Hash %%s missing the % in argument \f(CW%d\fR of %s()" 4
.IX Item "Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()"
(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.
.IP "%s has too many errors" 4
.IX Item "%s has too many errors"
(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.
.IP "Hexadecimal number > 0xffffffff non-portable" 4
.IX Item "Hexadecimal number > 0xffffffff non-portable"
(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32\-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
perlport for more on portability concerns.
.IP "Identifier too long" 4
.IX Item "Identifier too long"
(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like \f(CW$A::B\fR).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future versions
of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.
.ie n .IP "Illegal binary digit %s" 4
.el .IP "Illegal binary digit \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Illegal binary digit %s"
(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.
.ie n .IP "Illegal binary digit %s ignored" 4
.el .IP "Illegal binary digit \f(CW%s\fR ignored" 4
.IX Item "Illegal binary digit %s ignored"
(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a
binary number.  Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the
offending digit.
.ie n .IP "Illegal character %s (carriage return)" 4
.el .IP "Illegal character \f(CW%s\fR (carriage return)" 4
.IX Item "Illegal character %s (carriage return)"
(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it
would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error
when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.  Talk
to your Perl administrator.
.ie n .IP "Illegal character in prototype for %s\fR : \f(CW%s" 4

.IX Item "Illegal division by zero"
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in
your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against
meaningless input.
.ie n .IP "Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored" 4

.IX Item "Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored"
(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 \- 9 or
A \- F, a \- f in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal
number stopped before the illegal character.

(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.  Most
numbers don't take to this kindly.
.IP "Illegal number of bits in vec" 4
.IX Item "Illegal number of bits in vec"
(F) The number of bits in \fIvec()\fR (the third argument) must be a power of

.IP "Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|" 4
.IX Item "Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|"
(W internal) A warning peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl tried to read a logical
name or \s-1CLI\s0 symbol definition when preparing to iterate over \f(CW%ENV\fR, and
didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.
.ie n .IP "(in cleanup) %s" 4

.IX Item "(in cleanup) %s"
(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a \s-1\fIDESTROY\s0()\fR method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the
system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of
times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that

(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like.
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or
setgid, or when you specify \fB\-T\fR to turn it on explicitly.  The
tainting mechanism labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly
from the user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any

.IX Item "Integer overflow in %s number"
(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified
either as a literal or as an argument to \fIhex()\fR or \fIoct()\fR is too big for
your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number.
On a 32\-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl

discovered.
.IP "Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks" 4
.IX Item "Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks"
(S) A warning peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl keeps track of the number of times
you've called \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR, to determine whether the current call
to \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR should affect the current script or a subprocess (see
\&\*(L"exec \s-1LIST\s0\*(R" in perlvms).  Somehow, this count has become scrambled, so
Perl is making a guess and treating this \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR as a request to
terminate the Perl script and execute the specified command.

.IX Item "Modification of a read-only value attempted"
(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a

.IP "More than one argument to open" 4
.IX Item "More than one argument to open"
(F) The \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR function has been asked to open multiple files. This
can happen if you are trying to open a pipe to a command that takes a
list of arguments, but have forgotten to specify a piped open mode.
See \*(L"open\*(R" in perlfunc for details.

.el .IP "``my'' variable \f(CW%s\fR can't be in a package" 4
.IX Item "my variable %s can't be in a package"
(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use
\&\fIlocal()\fR if you want to localize a package variable.
.ie n .IP "Name ""%s::%s"" used only once: possible typo" 4
.el .IP "Name ``%s::%s'' used only once: possible typo" 4
.IX Item "Name %s::%s used only once: possible typo"
(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names.
If you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it
again somehow to suppress the message.  The \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR declaration is
provided for this purpose.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 This warning detects symbols that have been used only once so \f(CW$c\fR, \f(CW@c\fR,
\&\f(CW%c\fR, *c, &c, sub c{}, c(), and c (the filehandle or format) are considered
the same; if a program uses \f(CW$c\fR only once but also uses any of the others it
will not trigger this warning.
.IP "Negative '/' count in unpack" 4
.IX Item "Negative '/' count in unpack"
(F) The length count obtained from a length/code unpack operation was
negative.  See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Negative length" 4
.IX Item "Negative length"
(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer
length that is less than 0.  This is difficult to imagine.
.IP "Negative offset to vec in lvalue context" 4
.IX Item "Negative offset to vec in lvalue context"
(F) When \f(CW\*(C`vec\*(C'\fR is called in an lvalue context, the second argument must be
greater than or equal to zero.
.IP "Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses. So
things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal. The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered.
.Sp
Note that the minimal matching quantifiers, \f(CW\*(C`*?\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`+?\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`??\*(C'\fR appear to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See perlre.
.IP "%s never introduced" 4
.IX Item "%s never introduced"
(S internal) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of
scope before it could possibly have been used.
.ie n .IP "Newline in left-justified string for %s" 4
.el .IP "Newline in left-justified string for \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Newline in left-justified string for %s"
(W printf) There is a newline in a string to be left justified by 
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The padding spaces will appear after the newline, which is probably not
what you wanted.  Usually you should remove the newline from the string 
and put formatting characters in the \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR format.
.ie n .IP "No %s allowed while running setuid" 4
.el .IP "No \f(CW%s\fR allowed while running setuid" 4
.IX Item "No %s allowed while running setuid"
(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or
setgid script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there
will be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least
securable.  See perlsec.
.ie n .IP "No comma allowed after %s" 4
.el .IP "No comma allowed after \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "No comma allowed after %s"
(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or \*(L"indirect object\*(R" is not
allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.
.Sp
One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported a
constant to your name space with \fBuse\fR or \fBimport\fR while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating system
does not support that particular constant. Hopefully you did use an
explicit import list for the constants you expect to see, please see
\&\*(L"use\*(R" in perlfunc and \*(L"import\*(R" in perlfunc. While an explicit import list
would probably have caught this error earlier it naturally does not
remedy the fact that your operating system still does not support that
constant. Maybe you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import
list of \fBuse\fR or \fBimport\fR or in the constant name at the line where
this error was triggered?
.IP "No command into which to pipe on command line" 4
.IX Item "No command into which to pipe on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it
doesn't know where you want to pipe the output from this command.
.IP "No \s-1DB::DB\s0 routine defined" 4
.IX Item "No DB::DB routine defined"
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the \fB\-d\fR switch, but
for some reason the  current debugger (e.g. \fIperl5db.pl\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`Devel::\*(C'\fR
module) didn't define a routine to be called at the beginning of each
statement.
.IP "No dbm on this machine" 4
.IX Item "No dbm on this machine"
(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with \s-1SDBM\s0.  See SDBM_File.
.IP "No DB::sub routine defined" 4
.IX Item "No DB::sub routine defined"
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the \fB\-d\fR switch, but
for some reason the current debugger (e.g. \fIperl5db.pl\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`Devel::\*(C'\fR
module) didn't define a \f(CW\*(C`DB::sub\*(C'\fR routine to be called at the beginning
of each ordinary subroutine call.
.IP "No \fB\-e\fR allowed in setuid scripts" 4
.IX Item "No -e allowed in setuid scripts"
(F) A setuid script can't be specified by the user.
.IP "No error file after 2> or 2>> on command line" 4
.IX Item "No error file after 2> or 2>> on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '2>' or a '2>>' on the command line, but can't
find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stderr.
.IP "No group ending character '%c' found in template" 4
.IX Item "No group ending character '%c' found in template"
(F) A pack or unpack template has an opening '(' or '[' without its
matching counterpart. See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "No input file after < on command line" 4
.IX Item "No input file after < on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '<' on the command line, but can't find the
name of the file from which to read data for stdin.
.IP "No #! line" 4
.IX Item "No #! line"
(F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts have a well-formed #! line
even on machines that don't support the #! construct.
.ie n .IP """no"" not allowed in expression" 4
.el .IP "``no'' not allowed in expression" 4
.IX Item "no not allowed in expression"
(F) The \*(L"no\*(R" keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and
returns no useful value.  See perlmod.
.IP "No output file after > on command line" 4
.IX Item "No output file after > on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a lone '>' at the end of the command line, so it
doesn't know where you wanted to redirect stdout.
.IP "No output file after > or >> on command line" 4
.IX Item "No output file after > or >> on command line"
(F) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '>' or a '>>' on the command line, but can't
find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stdout.

.el .IP "No package name allowed for variable \f(CW%s\fR in ``our''" 4
.IX Item "No package name allowed for variable %s in our"
(F) Fully qualified variable names are not allowed in \*(L"our\*(R"

semantics.  Such syntax is reserved for future extensions.
.IP "No Perl script found in input" 4
.IX Item "No Perl script found in input"
(F) You called \f(CW\*(C`perl \-x\*(C'\fR, but no line was found in the file beginning

.IX Item "No such class %s"
(F) You provided a class qualifier in a \*(L"my\*(R" or \*(L"our\*(R" declaration, but
this class doesn't exist at this point in your program.
.IP "No such pipe open" 4
.IX Item "No such pipe open"
(P) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  The internal routine \fImy_pclose()\fR tried to
close a pipe which hadn't been opened.  This should have been caught
earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.
.ie n .IP "No such pseudo-hash field ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "No such pseudo-hash field ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "No such pseudo-hash field %s"
(F) You tried to access an array as a hash, but the field name used is

.IX Item "No such pseudo-hash field %s in variable %s of type %s"
(F) You tried to access a field of a typed variable where the type does
not know about the field name.  The field names are looked up in the
\&\f(CW%FIELDS\fR hash in the type package at compile time.  The \f(CW%FIELDS\fR hash is
\&\f(CW%usually\fR set up with the 'fields' pragma.
.IP "No such signal: SIG%s" 4
.IX Item "No such signal: SIG%s"
(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to \f(CW%SIG\fR that was

names on your system.
.IP "Not a \s-1CODE\s0 reference" 4
.IX Item "Not a CODE reference"
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a

use the \fIref()\fR function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See
also perlref.
.IP "Not a format reference" 4
.IX Item "Not a format reference"
(F) I'm not sure how you managed to generate a reference to an anonymous

.IP "Not a \s-1GLOB\s0 reference" 4
.IX Item "Not a GLOB reference"
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a \*(L"typeglob\*(R" (that is, a
symbol table entry that looks like \f(CW*foo\fR), but found a reference to
something else instead.  You can use the \fIref()\fR function to find out what
kind of ref it really was.  See perlref.
.IP "Not a \s-1HASH\s0 reference" 4
.IX Item "Not a HASH reference"
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but found a

(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array value, but found
a reference to something else instead.  You can use the \fIref()\fR function
to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See perlref.
.IP "Not a perl script" 4
.IX Item "Not a perl script"
(F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts have a well-formed #! line
even on machines that don't support the #! construct.  The line must
mention perl.
.IP "Not a \s-1SCALAR\s0 reference" 4
.IX Item "Not a SCALAR reference"

yourself.
.IP "no \s-1UTC\s0 offset information; assuming local time is \s-1UTC\s0" 4
.IX Item "no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC"
(S) A warning peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent
to \s-1UTC\s0.  If it's not, define the logical name
\&\fI\s-1SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL\s0\fR to translate to the number of seconds which

Use the \fIvec()\fR function to construct the file descriptor bitmasks for
select. See \*(L"select\*(R" in perlfunc
.IP "Null filename used" 4

(P debugging) Some internal routine called \fIrun()\fR with a null opcode
pointer.
.IP "Null picture in formline" 4
.IX Item "Null picture in formline"
(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture
specification.  It was found to be empty, which probably means you
supplied it an uninitialized value.  See perlform.

.IX Item "NULL regexp parameter"
(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.
.IP "Number too long" 4
.IX Item "Number too long"
(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to
about 250 characters.  You've exceeded that length.  Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation.  In
the meantime, try using scientific notation (e.g. \*(L"1e6\*(R" instead of

.IX Item "Odd number of elements in hash assignment"
(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.

.IX Item "Offset outside string"
(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with an offset
pointing outside the buffer.  This is difficult to imagine.  The sole
exception to this is that \f(CW\*(C`sysread()\*(C'\fRing past the buffer will extend

.IX Item "Operation %s: no method found, %s"
(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no

.el .IP "Operator or semicolon missing before \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Operator or semicolon missing before %s"
(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser
was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to
use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For
example, if you say \*(L"*foo *foo\*(R" it will be interpreted as if you said

(X) The \fImalloc()\fR function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  Perl has

.el .IP "Out of memory during ``large'' request for \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory during large request for %s"
(F) The \fImalloc()\fR function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request. However,
the request was judged large enough (compile\-time default is 64K), so a
possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.
.ie n .IP "Out of memory during request for %s" 4
.el .IP "Out of memory during request for \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory during request for %s"
(X|F) The \fImalloc()\fR function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.
.Sp
The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of \f(CW$^M\fR as an
emergency pool after \fIdie()\fRing with this message.  In this case the error
is trappable \fIonce\fR, and the error message will include the line and file
where the failed request happened.
.IP "Out of memory during ridiculously large request" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory during ridiculously large request"
(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+\*(L"small amount\*(R" bytes.  This error
is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
\&\f(CW$arr[time]\fR instead of \f(CW$arr[$time]\fR.
.IP "Out of memory for yacc stack" 4
.IX Item "Out of memory for yacc stack"
(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could continue
parsing, but \fIrealloc()\fR wouldn't give it more memory, virtual or

Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies.  In the above the
settings were that the \s-1LC_ALL\s0 was \*(L"En_US\*(R" and the \s-1LANG\s0 had no value.
This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your operating
system supplier and/or system administrator have set up the so-called
locale system but Perl could not use those settings.  This was not
dead serious, fortunately: there is a \*(L"default locale\*(R" called \*(L"C\*(R" that
Perl can and will use, the script will be run.  Before you really fix
the problem, however, you will get the same error message each time
you run Perl.  How to really fix the problem can be found in

Note that the \s-1POSIX\s0 character classes do \fBnot\fR have the \f(CW\*(C`is\*(C'\fR prefix

.IP "Possible attempt to put comments in \fIqw()\fR list" 4
.IX Item "Possible attempt to put comments in qw() list"
(W qw) \fIqw()\fR lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with literal
strings, comment characters are not ignored, but are instead treated as
literal data.  (You may have used different delimiters than the
parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently used.)
.Sp
You probably wrote something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    @list = qw(
\&        a # a comment
\&        b # another comment
\&    );
.Ve
.Sp

.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    @list = qw(
\&        a
\&        b

.Sp
If you really want comments, build your list the
old-fashioned way, with quotes and commas:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    @list = (
\&        'a',    # a comment
\&        'b',    # another comment

commas aren't needed to separate the items.  (You may have used
different delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also
frequently used.)
.Sp
You probably wrote something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    qw! a, b, c !;

(F) An \fIioctl()\fR or \fIfcntl()\fR returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the
end of the buffer just in case.  This sentinel byte got clobbered, and
Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted.  See \*(L"ioctl\*(R" in perlfunc.

(W precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction
with a numeric comparison operator, like this :
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ($x & $y == 0) { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
This expression is actually equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`$x & ($y == 0)\*(C'\fR, due to the
higher precedence of \f(CW\*(C`==\*(C'\fR. This is probably not what you want. (If you
really meant to write this, disable the warning, or, better, put the
parentheses explicitly and write \f(CW\*(C`$x & ($y == 0)\*(C'\fR).

because of the strict regularization of Perl 5's grammar into unary and

.IP "Reference to nonexistent group in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "Reference to nonexistent group in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) You used something like \f(CW\*(C`\e7\*(C'\fR in your regular expression, but there are
not at least seven sets of capturing parentheses in the expression. If you
wanted to have the character with value 7 inserted into the regular expression,
prepend a zero to make the number at least two digits: \f(CW\*(C`\e07\*(C'\fR

The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.

.IX Item "regexp memory corruption"
(P) The regular expression engine got confused by what the regular
expression compiler gave it.
.IP "Regexp out of space" 4
.IX Item "Regexp out of space"
(P) A \*(L"can't happen\*(R" error, because \fIsafemalloc()\fR should have caught it
earlier.
.IP "Repeated format line will never terminate (~~ and @# incompatible)" 4
.IX Item "Repeated format line will never terminate (~~ and @# incompatible)"
(F) Your format contains the ~~ repeat-until-blank sequence and a
numeric field that will never go blank so that the repetition never
terminates. You might use ^# instead.  See perlform.
.ie n .IP "Reversed %s= operator" 4
.el .IP "Reversed \f(CW%s\fR= operator" 4
.IX Item "Reversed %s= operator"
(W syntax) You wrote your assignment operator backwards.  The = must
always comes last, to avoid ambiguity with subsequent unary operators.
.IP "Runaway format" 4
.IX Item "Runaway format"
(F) Your format contained the ~~ repeat-until-blank sequence, but it
produced 200 lines at once, and the 200th line looked exactly like the
199th line.  Apparently you didn't arrange for the arguments to exhaust
themselves, either by using ^ instead of @ (for scalar variables), or by
shifting or popping (for array variables).  See perlform.
.ie n .IP "Scalars leaked: %d" 4
.el .IP "Scalars leaked: \f(CW%d\fR" 4
.IX Item "Scalars leaked: %d"
(P) Something went wrong in Perl's internal bookkeeping of scalars:
not all scalar variables were deallocated by the time Perl exited.
What this usually indicates is a memory leak, which is of course bad,
especially if the Perl program is intended to be long\-running.
.IP "Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]" 4
.IX Item "Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]"
(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a
single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar
value (indicated by $).  The difference is that \f(CW$foo[&bar]\fR always
behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its
argument, while \f(CW@foo[&bar]\fR behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things
if you're expecting only one subscript.
.Sp
On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array
element as a list, you need to look into how references work, because
Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.  See
perlref.
.IP "Scalar value @%s{%s} better written as $%s{%s}" 4
.IX Item "Scalar value @%s{%s} better written as $%s{%s}"
(W syntax) You've used a hash slice (indicated by @) to select a single
element of a hash.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value
(indicated by $).  The difference is that \f(CW$foo{&bar}\fR always behaves
like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its
argument, while \f(CW@foo{&bar}\fR behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things
if you're expecting only one subscript.

On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the hash element
as a list, you need to look into how references work, because Perl will

.IP "Script is not setuid/setgid in suidperl" 4
.IX Item "Script is not setuid/setgid in suidperl"
(F) Oddly, the suidperl program was invoked on a script without a setuid
or setgid bit set.  This doesn't make much sense.
.IP "Search pattern not terminated" 4
.IX Item "Search pattern not terminated"
(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a // or m{}
construct.  Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
Missing the leading \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR from a variable \f(CW$m\fR may cause this error.
.Sp
Note that since Perl 5.9.0 a // can also be the \fIdefined-or\fR
construct, not just the empty search pattern.  Therefore code written
in Perl 5.9.0 or later that uses the // as the \fIdefined-or\fR can be
misparsed by pre\-5.9.0 Perls as a non-terminated search pattern.
.IP "Search pattern not terminated or ternary operator parsed as search pattern" 4
.IX Item "Search pattern not terminated or ternary operator parsed as search pattern"
(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a \f(CW\*(C`?PATTERN?\*(C'\fR
construct.
.Sp
The question mark is also used as part of the ternary operator (as in
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo ? 0 : 1\*(C'\fR) leading to some ambiguous constructions being wrongly
parsed. One way to disambiguate the parsing is to put parentheses around
the conditional expression, i.e. \f(CW\*(C`(foo) ? 0 : 1\*(C'\fR.

This is the error message generally seen in a browser window when trying

varies widely from server to server. The most frequently-seen variants
are \*(L"500 Server error\*(R", \*(L"Method (something) not permitted\*(R", \*(L"Document

account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment variables
(like \s-1PATH\s0) from the user it isn't running under, and isn't in a

(F) Your system has the \fIsetpgrp()\fR from \s-1BSD\s0 4.2, which takes no

\&\*(L"setsockopt\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Setuid/gid script is writable by world" 4
.IX Item "Setuid/gid script is writable by world"
(F) The setuid emulator won't run a script that is writable by the

.ie n .IP "/%s/ should probably be written as ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "/%s/ should probably be written as ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "/%s/ should probably be written as %s"
(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,
as in the first argument to \f(CW\*(C`join\*(C'\fR.  Perl will treat the true or false
result of matching the pattern against \f(CW$_\fR as the string, which is
probably not what you had in mind.

.IX Item "sort is now a reserved word"
(F) An ancient error message that almost nobody ever runs into anymore.
But before sort was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a filehandle.
.IP "Sort subroutine didn't return a numeric value" 4
.IX Item "Sort subroutine didn't return a numeric value"
(F) A sort comparison routine must return a number.  You probably blew
it by not using \f(CW\*(C`<=>\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`cmp\*(C'\fR, or by not using them correctly.
See \*(L"sort\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Sort subroutine didn't return single value" 4
.IX Item "Sort subroutine didn't return single value"
(F) A sort comparison subroutine may not return a list value with more
or less than one element.  See \*(L"sort\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "\fIsplice()\fR offset past end of array" 4
.IX Item "splice() offset past end of array"
(W misc) You attempted to specify an offset that was past the end of
the array passed to \fIsplice()\fR. Splicing will instead commence at the end
of the array, rather than past it. If this isn't what you want, try
explicitly pre-extending the array by assigning $#array = \f(CW$offset\fR. See
\&\*(L"splice\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Split loop" 4
.IX Item "Split loop"
(P) The split was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a split shouldn't
iterate more times than there are characters of input, which is what
happened.) See \*(L"split\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Statement unlikely to be reached" 4
.IX Item "Statement unlikely to be reached"
(W exec) You did an \fIexec()\fR with some statement after it other than a
\&\fIdie()\fR.  This is almost always an error, because \fIexec()\fR never returns
unless there was a failure.  You probably wanted to use \fIsystem()\fR
instead, which does return.  To suppress this warning, put the \fIexec()\fR in
a block by itself.

.IX Item "substr outside of string"
(W substr),(F) You tried to reference a \fIsubstr()\fR that pointed outside of
a string.  That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the
length of the string.  See \*(L"substr\*(R" in perlfunc.  This warning is fatal if
substr is used in an lvalue context (as the left hand side of an

.IX Item "Switch (?(condition)... contains too many branches in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) A (?(condition)if\-clause|else\-clause) construct can have at most two

Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on \fB\-w\fR.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl \-c\*(C'\fR repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20\ questions.

.IX Item "The crypt() function is unimplemented due to excessive paranoia"
(F) Configure couldn't find the \fIcrypt()\fR function on your machine,
probably because your vendor didn't supply it, probably because they

wasn't built with a \s-1CRTL\s0 that contained the \fIsetenv()\fR function.  You'll
need to rebuild Perl with a \s-1CRTL\s0 that does, or redefine
\&\fI\s-1PERL_ENV_TABLES\s0\fR (see perlvms) so that the environ array isn't the
target of the change to
\&\f(CW%ENV\fR which produced the warning.

.IX Item "5.005 threads are deprecated"
(D deprecated)  The 5.005\-style threads (activated by \f(CW\*(C`use Thread;\*(C'\fR)

.IP "times not implemented" 4
.IX Item "times not implemented"
(F) Your version of the C library apparently doesn't do \fItimes()\fR.  I
suspect you're not running on Unix.
.ie n .IP """\-T"" is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line" 4
.el .IP "``\-T'' is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line" 4
.IX Item "-T is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line"
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
\&\fB\-T\fR option, but Perl was not invoked with \fB\-T\fR in its command line.
This is an error because, by the time Perl discovers a \fB\-T\fR in a
script, it's too late to properly taint everything from the environment.
So Perl gives up.
.Sp
If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by
editing the #! line so that the \fB\-T\fR option is a part of Perl's first
argument: e.g. change \f(CW\*(C`perl \-n \-T\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`perl \-T \-n\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If the Perl script is being executed as \f(CW\*(C`perl scriptname\*(C'\fR, then the
\&\fB\-T\fR option must appear on the command line: \f(CW\*(C`perl \-T scriptname\*(C'\fR.
.IP "To%s: illegal mapping '%s'" 4
.IX Item "To%s: illegal mapping '%s'"
(F) You tried to define a customized To-mapping for \fIlc()\fR, lcfirst,
\&\fIuc()\fR, or \fIucfirst()\fR (or their string-inlined versions), but you
specified an illegal mapping.
See \*(L"User\-Defined Character Properties\*(R" in perlunicode.
.IP "Too deeply nested ()\-groups" 4
.IX Item "Too deeply nested ()-groups"
(F) Your template contains ()\-groups with a ridiculously deep nesting level. 
.IP "Too few args to syscall" 4
.IX Item "Too few args to syscall"
(F) There has to be at least one argument to \fIsyscall()\fR to specify the
system call to call, silly dilly.
.ie n .IP "Too late for ""\-%s"" option" 4
.el .IP "Too late for ``\-%s'' option" 4
.IX Item "Too late for -%s option"
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
\&\fB\-M\fR or \fB\-m\fR option.  This is an error because \fB\-M\fR and \fB\-m\fR options
are not intended for use inside scripts.  Use the \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR pragma instead.
.ie n .IP "Too late to run %s block" 4
.el .IP "Too late to run \f(CW%s\fR block" 4
.IX Item "Too late to run %s block"
(W void) A \s-1CHECK\s0 or \s-1INIT\s0 block is being defined during run time proper,
when the opportunity to run them has already passed.  Perhaps you are
loading a file with \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR when you should be using \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR
instead.  Or perhaps you should put the \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR inside a
\&\s-1BEGIN\s0 block.
.IP "Too many args to syscall" 4
.IX Item "Too many args to syscall"
(F) Perl supports a maximum of only 14 args to \fIsyscall()\fR.
.ie n .IP "Too many arguments for %s" 4

.IX Item "Too many arguments for %s"
(F) The function requires fewer arguments than you specified.

.IX Item "Trailing  in regex m/%s/"
(F) The regular expression ends with an unbackslashed backslash.
Backslash it.   See perlre.
.IP "Transliteration pattern not terminated" 4
.IX Item "Transliteration pattern not terminated"
(F) The lexer couldn't find the interior delimiter of a tr/// or tr[][]
or y/// or y[][] construct.  Missing the leading \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR from variables
\&\f(CW$tr\fR or \f(CW$y\fR may cause this error.
.IP "Transliteration replacement not terminated" 4
.IX Item "Transliteration replacement not terminated"
(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a tr///, tr[][],
y/// or y[][] construct.
.IP "'%s' trapped by operation mask" 4
.IX Item "'%s' trapped by operation mask"
(F) You tried to use an operator from a Safe compartment in which it's
disallowed. See Safe.
.IP "truncate not implemented" 4
.IX Item "truncate not implemented"
(F) Your machine doesn't implement a file truncation mechanism that
Configure knows about.

.IX Item "Type of arg %d to %s must be %s (not %s)"
(F) This function requires the argument in that position to be of a
certain type.  Arrays must be \f(CW@NAME\fR or \f(CW\*(C`@{EXPR}\*(C'\fR.  Hashes must be
\&\f(CW%NAME\fR or \f(CW\*(C`%{EXPR}\*(C'\fR.  No implicit dereferencing is allowed\*(--use the

.IX Item "umask not implemented"
(F) Your machine doesn't implement the umask function and you tried to
use it to restrict permissions for yourself (\s-1EXPR\s0 & 0700).
.ie n .IP "Unable to create sub named ""%s""" 4

(F) The sort comparison routine specified doesn't seem to exist.
Perhaps it's in a different package?  See \*(L"sort\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Undefined subroutine &%s called" 4
.IX Item "Undefined subroutine &%s called"
(F) The subroutine indicated hasn't been defined, or if it was, it has
since been undefined.
.IP "Undefined subroutine called" 4
.IX Item "Undefined subroutine called"
(F) The anonymous subroutine you're trying to call hasn't been defined,
or if it was, it has since been undefined.
.IP "Undefined subroutine in sort" 4
.IX Item "Undefined subroutine in sort"
(F) The sort comparison routine specified is declared but doesn't seem
to have been defined yet.  See \*(L"sort\*(R" in perlfunc.

.IX Item "Undefined value assigned to typeglob"
(W misc) An undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la

\&\f(CW\*(C`undef *foo\*(C'\fR.
.IP "%s: Undefined variable" 4
.IX Item "%s: Undefined variable"
(A) You've accidentally run your script through \fBcsh\fR instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.
.ie n .IP "unexec of %s\fR into \f(CW%s failed!" 4
.el .IP "unexec of \f(CW%s\fR into \f(CW%s\fR failed!" 4
.IX Item "unexec of %s into %s failed!"
(F) The \fIunexec()\fR routine failed for some reason.  See your local \s-1FSF\s0

.ie n .IP "Unicode character %s is illegal" 4
.el .IP "Unicode character \f(CW%s\fR is illegal" 4
.IX Item "Unicode character %s is illegal"
(W utf8) Certain Unicode characters have been designated off-limits by

what you are doing you can turn off this warning by \f(CW\*(C`no warnings 'utf8';\*(C'\fR.
.IP "Unknown \s-1BYTEORDER\s0" 4
.IX Item "Unknown BYTEORDER"
(F) There are no byte-swapping functions for a machine with this byte
order.
.IP "Unknown \fIopen()\fR mode '%s'" 4
.IX Item "Unknown open() mode '%s'"
(F) The second argument of 3\-argument \fIopen()\fR is not among the list
of valid modes: \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`>>\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`+<\*(C'\fR,

.ie n .IP "Unknown PerlIO layer ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "Unknown PerlIO layer ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "Unknown PerlIO layer %s"
(W layer) An attempt was made to push an unknown layer onto the Perl I/O
system.  (Layers take care of transforming data between external and
internal representations.)  Note that some layers, such as \f(CW\*(C`mmap\*(C'\fR,
are not supported in all environments.  If your program didn't
explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the result of the
value of the environment variable \s-1PERLIO\s0.
.ie n .IP "Unknown process %x\fR sent message to prime_env_iter: \f(CW%s" 4
.el .IP "Unknown process \f(CW%x\fR sent message to prime_env_iter: \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Unknown process %x sent message to prime_env_iter: %s"
(P) An error peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl was reading values for \f(CW%ENV\fR before
iterating over it, and someone else stuck a message in the stream of
data Perl expected.  Someone's very confused, or perhaps trying to
subvert Perl's population of \f(CW%ENV\fR for nefarious purposes.
.ie n .IP "Unknown ""re"" subpragma '%s' (known ones are: %s)" 4
.el .IP "Unknown ``re'' subpragma '%s' (known ones are: \f(CW%s\fR)" 4

You tried to use an unknown subpragma of the \*(L"re\*(R" pragma.
.IP "Unknown switch condition (?(%.2s in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "Unknown switch condition (?(%.2s in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) The condition part of a (?(condition)if\-clause|else\-clause) construct
is not known. The condition may be lookahead or lookbehind (the condition
is true if the lookahead or lookbehind is true), a (?{...})  construct (the
condition is true if the code evaluates to a true value), or a number (the
condition is true if the set of capturing parentheses named by the number
matched).
.Sp
The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.  See perlre.
.IP "Unknown Unicode option letter '%c'" 4
.IX Item "Unknown Unicode option letter '%c'"
You specified an unknown Unicode option.  See perlrun documentation
of the \f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR switch for the list of known options.
.ie n .IP "Unknown Unicode option value %x" 4
.el .IP "Unknown Unicode option value \f(CW%x\fR" 4

You specified an unknown Unicode option.  See perlrun documentation
of the \f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR switch for the list of known options.
.IP "Unknown warnings category '%s'" 4
.IX Item "Unknown warnings category '%s'"
(F) An error issued by the \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR pragma. You specified a warnings
category that is unknown to perl at this point.
.Sp
Note that if you want to enable a warnings category registered by a module
(e.g. \f(CW\*(C`use warnings 'File::Find'\*(C'\fR), you must have imported this module
first.
.IP "unmatched [ in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "unmatched [ in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) The brackets around a character class must match. If you wish to
include a closing bracket in a character class, backslash it or put it
first. The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows in the regular expression about where the problem
was discovered. See perlre.
.IP "unmatched ( in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/" 4
.IX Item "unmatched ( in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(F) Unbackslashed parentheses must always be balanced in regular
expressions. If you're a vi user, the % key is valuable for finding the
matching parenthesis. The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows in the regular expression about
where the problem was discovered. See perlre.
.ie n .IP "Unmatched right %s bracket" 4
.el .IP "Unmatched right \f(CW%s\fR bracket" 4
.IX Item "Unmatched right %s bracket"
(F) The lexer counted more closing curly or square brackets than opening
ones, so you're probably missing a matching opening bracket.  As a
general rule, you'll find the missing one (so to speak) near the place
you were last editing.
.ie n .IP "Unquoted string ""%s"" may clash with future reserved word" 4
.el .IP "Unquoted string ``%s'' may clash with future reserved word" 4
.IX Item "Unquoted string %s may clash with future reserved word"
(W reserved) You used a bareword that might someday be claimed as a
reserved word.  It's best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize it
somehow, or insert an underbar into it.  You might also declare it as a
subroutine.
.ie n .IP "Unrecognized character %s" 4
.el .IP "Unrecognized character \f(CW%s\fR" 4
.IX Item "Unrecognized character %s"
(F) The Perl parser has no idea what to do with the specified character
in your Perl script (or eval).  Perhaps you tried to run a compressed
script, a binary program, or a directory as a Perl program.
.IP "/%s/: Unrecognized escape \e\e%c in character class passed through" 4
.IX Item "/%s/: Unrecognized escape %c in character class passed through"
(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not
recognized by Perl inside character classes.  The character was
understood literally.

.IX Item "Unrecognized escape %c passed through"
(W misc) You used a backslash-character combination which is not
recognized by Perl.

.IX Item "Unrecognized escape %c passed through in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not
recognized by Perl. This combination appears in an interpolated variable or
a \f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR\-delimited regular expression. The character was understood
literally. The <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 shows in the regular expression about where the
escape was discovered.
.ie n .IP "Unrecognized signal name ""%s""" 4
.el .IP "Unrecognized signal name ``%s''" 4
.IX Item "Unrecognized signal name %s"
(F) You specified a signal name to the \fIkill()\fR function that was not
recognized.  Say \f(CW\*(C`kill \-l\*(C'\fR in your shell to see the valid signal names
on your system.
.IP "Unrecognized switch: \-%s  (\-h will show valid options)" 4
.IX Item "Unrecognized switch: -%s  (-h will show valid options)"
(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl.  Don't do that.  (If you

bad switch on your behalf.)
.ie n .IP "Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline" 4
.el .IP "Unsuccessful \f(CW%s\fR on filename containing newline" 4
.IX Item "Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline"
(W newline) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and that
operation failed, \s-1PROBABLY\s0 because the filename contained a newline,

.IX Item "Unsupported function %s"
(F) This machine doesn't implement the indicated function, apparently.
At least, Configure doesn't think so.

.IX Item "Unsupported function fork"
(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.
.Sp
Note that under some systems, like \s-1OS/2\s0, there may be different flavors
of Perl executables, some of which may support fork, some not. Try
changing the name you call Perl by to \f(CW\*(C`perl_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`perl_\|_\*(C'\fR, and so on.
.ie n .IP "Unsupported script encoding %s" 4
.el .IP "Unsupported script encoding \f(CW%s\fR" 4

declares it to be in a Unicode encoding that Perl cannot read.
.ie n .IP "Unsupported socket function ""%s"" called" 4
.el .IP "Unsupported socket function ``%s'' called" 4
.IX Item "Unsupported socket function %s called"
(F) Your machine doesn't support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at
least that's what Configure thought.
.IP "Unterminated attribute list" 4
.IX Item "Unterminated attribute list"
(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the
start of an attribute, and it wasn't a semicolon or the start of a
block.  Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous
attribute too soon.  See attributes.
.IP "Unterminated attribute parameter in attribute list" 4
.IX Item "Unterminated attribute parameter in attribute list"
(F) The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character while parsing
an attribute list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis
character was not found.  You may need to add (or remove) a backslash
character to get your parentheses to balance.  See attributes.
.IP "Unterminated compressed integer" 4
.IX Item "Unterminated compressed integer"
(F) An argument to unpack(\*(L"w\*(R",...) was incompatible with the \s-1BER\s0
compressed integer format and could not be converted to an integer.
See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc.
.IP "Unterminated <> operator" 4
.IX Item "Unterminated <> operator"
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a \*(L"less than\*(R".
.ie n .IP "untie attempted while %d inner references still exist" 4
.el .IP "untie attempted while \f(CW%d\fR inner references still exist" 4

.IX Item "Useless (?-%s) - don't use /%s modifier in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(W regexp) You have used an internal modifier such as (?\-o) that has no

.Vb 1
\&    if ($string =~ /(?-o)$pattern/o) { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
must be written as

.IX Item "Useless (?%s) - use /%s modifier in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/"
(W regexp) You have used an internal modifier such as (?o) that has no
meaning unless applied to the entire regexp:
.Sp

.Ve
.Sp
must be written as
.Sp
.Vb 1

.ie n .IP "Useless use of %s in void context" 4
.el .IP "Useless use of \f(CW%s\fR in void context" 4
.IX Item "Useless use of %s in void context"
(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a
value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very
often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl
to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd
get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $one, $two = 1, 2;
.Ve
.Sp
when you meant to say
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);
.Ve
.Sp
Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $array = (1,2);
.Ve
.Sp
when you should have said
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $array = [1,2];
.Ve
.Sp
The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See
perlref for more on this.
.Sp
This warning will not be issued for numerical constants equal to 0 or 1
since they are often used in statements like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    1 while sub_with_side_effects();
.Ve
.Sp
String constants that would normally evaluate to 0 or 1 are warned
about.

apart from the array, like \f(CW\*(C`push(@x)\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unshift(@foo)\*(C'\fR. That won't
usually have any effect on the array, so is completely useless. It's
possible in principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect
if the array is tied to a class which implements a \s-1PUSH\s0 method. If so,
you can write it as \f(CW\*(C`push(@tied_array,())\*(C'\fR to avoid this warning.

(D deprecated) \fIchdir()\fR with no arguments is documented to change to
\&\f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1HOME\s0} or \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1LOGDIR\s0}.  chdir(undef) and chdir('') share this

Be careful to check that what you pass to \fIchdir()\fR is defined and not

.IP "Use of /c modifier is meaningless in s///" 4
.IX Item "Use of /c modifier is meaningless in s///"
(W regexp) You used the /c modifier in a substitution.  The /c
modifier is not presently meaningful in substitutions.
.IP "Use of /c modifier is meaningless without /g" 4
.IX Item "Use of /c modifier is meaningless without /g"
(W regexp) You used the /c modifier with a regex operand, but didn't
use the /g modifier.  Currently, /c is meaningful only when /g is
used.  (This may change in the future.)
.IP "Use of freed value in iteration" 4
.IX Item "Use of freed value in iteration"
(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop?
This error is typically caused by code like the following:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    @a = (3,4);
\&    @a = () for (1,2,@a);
.Ve
.Sp
You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated over.
For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full
reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an item in the
middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.
.IP "Use of *glob{\s-1FILEHANDLE\s0} is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "Use of *glob{FILEHANDLE} is deprecated"
(D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the shorter *glob{\s-1IO\s0} form
to access the filehandle slot within a typeglob.
.IP "Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split" 4
.IX Item "Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split"
(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR
operator.  Since \f(CW\*(C`split\*(C'\fR always tries to match the pattern
repeatedly, the \f(CW\*(C`/g\*(C'\fR has no effect.
.ie n .IP "Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated" 4
.el .IP "Use of implicit split to \f(CW@_\fR is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated"
(D deprecated) It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber
a subroutine's argument list, so it's better if you assign the results
of a \fIsplit()\fR explicitly to an array (or list).
.IP "Use of inherited \s-1AUTOLOAD\s0 for non-method %s() is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated"
(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR subroutines
are looked up as methods (using the \f(CW@ISA\fR hierarchy) even when the
subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
\&\f(CW\*(C`Foo::bar()\*(C'\fR), not as methods (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`Foo\->bar()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`$obj\->bar()\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fRs.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
\&\f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fRs.
.Sp
The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non\-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting \f(CW\*(C`AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR for non-methods from a base class
named \f(CW\*(C`BaseClass\*(C'\fR, execute \f(CW\*(C`*AUTOLOAD = \e&BaseClass::AUTOLOAD\*(C'\fR during
startup.
.Sp
In code that currently says \f(CW\*(C`use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);\*(C'\fR
you should remove AutoLoader from \f(CW@ISA\fR and change \f(CW\*(C`use AutoLoader;\*(C'\fR to
\&\f(CW\*(C`use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';\*(C'\fR.

(F) You attempted to use a feature of printf that is accessible from
only C.  This usually means there's a better way to do it in Perl.
.IP "Use of $* is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "Use of $* is deprecated"
(D deprecated) This variable magically turned on multi-line pattern
matching, both for you and for any luckless subroutine that you happen
to call.  You should use the new \f(CW\*(C`//m\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`//s\*(C'\fR modifiers now to do
that without the dangerous action-at-a-distance effects of \f(CW$*\fR.

.IX Item "Use of package with no arguments is deprecated"
(D deprecated) You used the \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR keyword without specifying a package
name. So no namespace is current at all. Using this can cause many
otherwise reasonable constructs to fail in baffling ways. \f(CW\*(C`use strict;\*(C'\fR
instead.
.ie n .IP "Use of reference ""%s"" as array index" 4
.el .IP "Use of reference ``%s'' as array index" 4
.IX Item "Use of reference %s as array index"
(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably
isn't what you mean, because references in numerical context tend
to be huge numbers, and so usually indicates programmer error.
.Sp
If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your reference, like so:
\&\f(CW$array[0+$ref]\fR.  This warning is not given for overloaded objects,
either, because you can overload the numification and stringification
operators and then you assumedly know what you are doing.
.ie n .IP "Use of reserved word ""%s"" is deprecated" 4
.el .IP "Use of reserved word ``%s'' is deprecated" 4
.IX Item "Use of reserved word %s is deprecated"
(D deprecated) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future
versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so you're better off either
explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of
use, or using a different name altogether.  The warning can be
suppressed for subroutine names by either adding a \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR prefix, or using
a package qualifier, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`&our()\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`Foo::our()\*(C'\fR.

(W taint, deprecated) You have supplied \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`exec()\*(C'\fR with multiple
arguments and at least one of them is tainted.  This used to be allowed
but will become a fatal error in a future version of perl.  Untaint your
arguments.  See perlsec.
.IP "Use of uninitialized value%s" 4
.IX Item "Use of uninitialized value%s"
(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
defined.  It was interpreted as a "" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.
To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.
.Sp
To help you figure out what was undefined, perl tells you what operation
you used the undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your
program and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily
appear literally in your program.  For example, \f(CW"that $foo"\fR is
usually optimized into \f(CW\*(C`"that " . $foo\*(C'\fR, and the warning will refer to
the \f(CW\*(C`concatenation (.)\*(C'\fR operator, even though there is no \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR in your
program.

(W utf8) You tried to generate half of an \s-1UTF\-16\s0 surrogate by
requesting a Unicode character between the code points 0xD800 and
0xDFFF (inclusive).  That range is reserved exclusively for the use of
\&\s-1UTF\-16\s0 encoding (by having two 16\-bit \s-1UCS\-2\s0 characters); but Perl
encodes its characters in \s-1UTF\-8\s0, so what you got is a very illegal
character.  If you really know what you are doing you can turn off
this warning by \f(CW\*(C`no warnings 'utf8';\*(C'\fR.

\&\f(CW\*(C`each()\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`readdir()\*(C'\fR as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs
can return a value of \*(L"0\*(R"; that would make the conditional expression

(W misc) A warning peculiar to \s-1VMS\s0.  Perl tried to read the value of an

(F) While \*(L"use strict\*(R" in effect, you referred to a global variable that
you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by

.IX Item "Variable %s may be unavailable"
(W closure) An inner (nested) \fIanonymous\fR subroutine is inside a
\&\fInamed\fR subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the
anonymous (innermost) subroutine is referencing a lexical variable
defined in the outermost subroutine.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   sub outermost { my $a; sub middle { sub { $a } } }
.Ve
.Sp
If the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced (directly or
indirectly) from the outermost subroutine, it will share the variable as
you would expect.  But if the anonymous subroutine is called or
referenced when the outermost subroutine is not active, it will see the
value of the shared variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outermost subroutine, which is probably not what you want.
.Sp
In these circumstances, it is usually best to make the middle subroutine
anonymous, using the \f(CW\*(C`sub {}\*(C'\fR syntax.  Perl has specific support for
shared variables in nested anonymous subroutines; a named subroutine in
between interferes with this feature.

.ie n .IP "Variable ""%s"" will not stay shared" 4
.el .IP "Variable ``%s'' will not stay shared" 4
.IX Item "Variable %s will not stay shared"
(W closure) An inner (nested) \fInamed\fR subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer subroutine.
.Sp
When the inner subroutine is called, it will probably see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.
.Sp
Furthermore, if the outer subroutine is anonymous and references a
lexical variable outside itself, then the outer and inner subroutines
will \fInever\fR share the given variable.
.Sp
This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the \f(CW\*(C`sub {}\*(C'\fR syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are called or referenced, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.

(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that
looks like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a
term or unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand
function has a default argument of 1.0, and you write
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    rand + 5;
.Ve
.Sp
you may \s-1THINK\s0 you wrote the same thing as

(W utf8) Perl met a wide character (>255) when it wasn't expecting

way to quiet this warning is simply to add the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR layer to the

warning is to add \f(CW\*(C`no warnings 'utf8';\*(C'\fR but that is often closer to
