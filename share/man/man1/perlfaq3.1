.SH "NAME"
perlfaq3 \- Programming Tools ($Revision: 1.56 $, $Date: 2005/12/31 00:54:37 $)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This section of the \s-1FAQ\s0 answers questions related to programmer tools
and programming support.
.Sh "How do I do (anything)?"
.IX Subsection "How do I do (anything)?"
Have you looked at \s-1CPAN\s0 (see perlfaq2)?  The chances are that
someone has already written a module that can solve your problem.
Have you read the appropriate manpages?  Here's a brief index:
.PP
.Vb 12
\&        Basics          perldata, perlvar, perlsyn, perlop, perlsub
\&        Execution       perlrun, perldebug
\&        Functions       perlfunc
\&        Objects         perlref, perlmod, perlobj, perltie
\&        Data Structures perlref, perllol, perldsc
\&        Modules         perlmod, perlmodlib, perlsub
\&        Regexes         perlre, perlfunc, perlop, perllocale
\&        Moving to perl5 perltrap, perl
\&        Linking w/C     perlxstut, perlxs, perlcall, perlguts, perlembed
\&        Various         http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz
\&                        (not a man-page but still useful, a collection
\&                         of various essays on Perl techniques)
.Ve
.PP
A crude table of contents for the Perl manpage set is found in perltoc.
.Sh "How can I use Perl interactively?"
.IX Subsection "How can I use Perl interactively?"
The typical approach uses the Perl debugger, described in the
\&\fIperldebug\fR\|(1) manpage, on an \*(L"empty\*(R" program, like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl -de 42
.Ve
.PP
Now just type in any legal Perl code, and it will be immediately
evaluated.  You can also examine the symbol table, get stack
backtraces, check variable values, set breakpoints, and other
operations typically found in symbolic debuggers.
.Sh "Is there a Perl shell?"
.IX Subsection "Is there a Perl shell?"
The psh (Perl sh) is currently at version 1.8. The Perl Shell is a shell
that combines the interactive nature of a Unix shell with the power of
Perl. The goal is a full featured shell that behaves as expected for
normal shell activity and uses Perl syntax and functionality for
control-flow statements and other things. You can get psh at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/psh/ .
.PP
Zoidberg is a similar project and provides a shell written in perl,
configured in perl and operated in perl. It is intended as a login shell
and development environment. It can be found at http://zoidberg.sf.net/
or your local \s-1CPAN\s0 mirror.
.PP
The Shell.pm module (distributed with Perl) makes Perl try commands
which aren't part of the Perl language as shell commands.  perlsh from
the source distribution is simplistic and uninteresting, but may still
be what you want.
.Sh "How do I find which modules are installed on my system?"
.IX Subsection "How do I find which modules are installed on my system?"
You can use the ExtUtils::Installed module to show all installed
distributions, although it can take awhile to do its magic.  The
standard library which comes with Perl just shows up as \*(L"Perl\*(R" (although
you can get those with Module::CoreList).
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use ExtUtils::Installed;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        my $inst    = ExtUtils::Installed->new();
\&        my @modules = $inst->modules();
.Ve
.PP
If you want a list of all of the Perl module filenames, you
can use File::Find::Rule.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use File::Find::Rule;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        my @files = File::Find::Rule->file()->name( '*.pm' )->in( @INC );
.Ve
.PP
If you do not have that module, you can do the same thing
with File::Find which is part of the standard library.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use File::Find;
\&    my @files;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    find(
\&      sub {
\&        push @files, $File::Find::name
\&                if -f $File::Find::name && /\e.pm$/
\&        },
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&      @INC
\&      );
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print join "\en", @files;
.Ve
.PP
If you simply need to quickly check to see if a module is
available, you can check for its documentation.  If you can
read the documentation the module is most likely installed.
If you cannot read the documentation, the module might not
have any (in rare cases).
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        prompt% perldoc Module::Name
.Ve
.PP
You can also try to include the module in a one-liner to see if
perl finds it.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl -MModule::Name -e1
.Ve
.Sh "How do I debug my Perl programs?"
.IX Subsection "How do I debug my Perl programs?"
Have you tried \f(CW\*(C`use warnings\*(C'\fR or used \f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR?  They enable warnings
to detect dubious practices.
.PP
Have you tried \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR?  It prevents you from using symbolic
references, makes you predeclare any subroutines that you call as bare
words, and (probably most importantly) forces you to predeclare your
variables with \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`use vars\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Did you check the return values of each and every system call?  The operating
system (and thus Perl) tells you whether they worked, and if not
why.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  open(FH, "> /etc/cantwrite")
\&    or die "Couldn't write to /etc/cantwrite: $!\en";
.Ve
.PP
Did you read perltrap?  It's full of gotchas for old and new Perl
programmers and even has sections for those of you who are upgrading
from languages like \fIawk\fR and \fIC\fR.
.PP
Have you tried the Perl debugger, described in perldebug?  You can
step through your program and see what it's doing and thus work out
why what it's doing isn't what it should be doing.
.Sh "How do I profile my Perl programs?"
.IX Subsection "How do I profile my Perl programs?"
You should get the Devel::DProf module from the standard distribution
(or separately on \s-1CPAN\s0) and also use Benchmark.pm from the standard
distribution.  The Benchmark module lets you time specific portions of
your code, while Devel::DProf gives detailed breakdowns of where your
code spends its time.
.PP
Here's a sample use of Benchmark:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Benchmark;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  @junk = `cat /etc/motd`;
\&  $count = 10_000;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  timethese($count, {
\&            'map' => sub { my @a = @junk;
\&                           map { s/a/b/ } @a;
\&                           return @a },
\&            'for' => sub { my @a = @junk;
\&                           for (@a) { s/a/b/ };
\&                           return @a },
\&           });
.Ve
.PP
This is what it prints (on one machine\*(--your results will be dependent
on your hardware, operating system, and the load on your machine):
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  Benchmark: timing 10000 iterations of for, map...
\&         for:  4 secs ( 3.97 usr  0.01 sys =  3.98 cpu)
\&         map:  6 secs ( 4.97 usr  0.00 sys =  4.97 cpu)
.Ve
.PP
Be aware that a good benchmark is very hard to write.  It only tests the
data you give it and proves little about the differing complexities
of contrasting algorithms.
.Sh "How do I cross-reference my Perl programs?"
.IX Subsection "How do I cross-reference my Perl programs?"
The B::Xref module can be used to generate cross-reference reports
for Perl programs.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] scriptname.plx
.Ve
.Sh "Is there a pretty-printer (formatter) for Perl?"
.IX Subsection "Is there a pretty-printer (formatter) for Perl?"
Perltidy is a Perl script which indents and reformats Perl scripts
to make them easier to read by trying to follow the rules of the
perlstyle. If you write Perl scripts, or spend much time reading
them, you will probably find it useful.  It is available at
http://perltidy.sourceforge.net
.PP
Of course, if you simply follow the guidelines in perlstyle,
you shouldn't need to reformat.  The habit of formatting your code
as you write it will help prevent bugs.  Your editor can and should
help you with this.  The perl-mode or newer cperl-mode for emacs
can provide remarkable amounts of help with most (but not all)
code, and even less programmable editors can provide significant
assistance.  Tom Christiansen and many other \s-1VI\s0 users  swear by
the following settings in vi and its clones:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    set ai sw=4
\&    map! ^O {^M}^[O^T
.Ve
.PP
Put that in your \fI.exrc\fR file (replacing the caret characters
with control characters) and away you go.  In insert mode, ^T is
for indenting, ^D is for undenting, and ^O is for blockdenting\*(--
as it were.  A more complete example, with comments, can be found at
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz
.PP
The a2ps http://www\-inf.enst.fr/%7Edemaille/a2ps/black+white.ps.gz does
lots of things related to generating nicely printed output of
documents, as does enscript at http://people.ssh.fi/mtr/genscript/ .
.Sh "Is there a ctags for Perl?"
.IX Subsection "Is there a ctags for Perl?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
Exuberent ctags supports Perl: http://ctags.sourceforge.net/
.PP
You might also try pltags: http://www.mscha.com/pltags.zip
.Sh "Is there an \s-1IDE\s0 or Windows Perl Editor?"
.IX Subsection "Is there an IDE or Windows Perl Editor?"
Perl programs are just plain text, so any editor will do.
.PP
If you're on Unix, you already have an IDE\*(--Unix itself.  The \s-1UNIX\s0
philosophy is the philosophy of several small tools that each do one
thing and do it well.  It's like a carpenter's toolbox.
.PP
If you want an \s-1IDE\s0, check the following (in alphabetical order, not
order of preference):
.IP "Eclipse" 4

that comes with support for Perl:
.PP
For editors: if you're on Unix you probably have vi or a vi clone
already, and possibly an emacs too, so you may not need to download
anything. In any emacs the cperl-mode (M\-x cperl\-mode) gives you
perhaps the best available Perl editing mode in any editor.
.PP
If you are using Windows, you can use any editor that lets you work
with plain text, such as NotePad or WordPad.  Word processors, such as
Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, typically do not work since they insert
all sorts of behind-the-scenes information, although some allow you to
save files as \*(L"Text Only\*(R". You can also download text editors designed
specifically for programming, such as Textpad (
http://www.textpad.com/ ) and UltraEdit ( http://www.ultraedit.com/ ),
among others.
.PP
If you are using MacOS, the same concerns apply.  MacPerl (for Classic
environments) comes with a simple editor. Popular external editors are
BBEdit ( http://www.bbedit.com/ ) or Alpha (
http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html ). MacOS X users can use
Unix editors as well. Neil Bowers (the man behind Geekcruises) has a
list of Mac editors that can handle Perl (

nvi ( http://www.bostic.com/vi/ , available from \s-1CPAN\s0 in src/misc/) is
yet another vi clone, unfortunately not available for Windows, but in
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 platforms you might be interested in trying it out, firstly because
strictly speaking it is not a vi clone, it is the real vi, or the new
incarnation of it, and secondly because you can embed Perl inside it
to use Perl as the scripting language.  nvi is not alone in this,
though: at least also vim and vile offer an embedded Perl.
.PP
The following are Win32 multilanguage editor/IDESs that support Perl:

.PP
There is also a toyedit Text widget based editor written in Perl
that is distributed with the Tk module on \s-1CPAN\s0.  The ptkdb
( http://world.std.com/~aep/ptkdb/ ) is a Perl/tk based debugger that
acts as a development environment of sorts.  Perl Composer
( http://perlcomposer.sourceforge.net/ ) is an \s-1IDE\s0 for Perl/Tk
\&\s-1GUI\s0 creation.
.PP
In addition to an editor/IDE you might be interested in a more
powerful shell environment for Win32.  Your options include
.IP "Bash" 4
.IX Item "Bash"
from the Cygwin package ( http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/ )
.IP "Ksh" 4
.IX Item "Ksh"
from the \s-1MKS\s0 Toolkit ( http://www.mks.com/ ), or the Bourne shell of
the U/WIN environment ( http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/ )

.PP
\&\s-1MKS\s0 and U/WIN are commercial (U/WIN is free for educational and
research purposes), Cygwin is covered by the \s-1GNU\s0 Public License (but
that shouldn't matter for Perl use).  The Cygwin, \s-1MKS\s0, and U/WIN all
contain (in addition to the shells) a comprehensive set of standard
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 toolkit utilities.
.PP
If you're transferring text files between Unix and Windows using \s-1FTP\s0
be sure to transfer them in \s-1ASCII\s0 mode so the ends of lines are
appropriately converted.
.PP
On Mac \s-1OS\s0 the MacPerl Application comes with a simple 32k text editor
that behaves like a rudimentary \s-1IDE\s0.  In contrast to the MacPerl Application
the \s-1MPW\s0 Perl tool can make use of the \s-1MPW\s0 Shell itself as an editor (with
no 32k limit).
.IP "Affrus" 4
.IX Item "Affrus"
is a full Perl development environment with full debugger support
( http://www.latenightsw.com ).
.IP "Alpha" 4

perl\-mode.el and support for the Perl debugger built in.  These should
come with the standard Emacs 19 distribution.
.PP
In the Perl source directory, you'll find a directory called \*(L"emacs\*(R",
which contains a cperl-mode that color-codes keywords, provides
context-sensitive help, and other nifty things.
.PP
Note that the perl-mode of emacs will have fits with \f(CW"main'foo"\fR
(single quote), and mess up the indentation and highlighting.  You
are probably using \f(CW"main::foo"\fR in new Perl code anyway, so this
shouldn't be an issue.

.Sh "How can I make my Perl program run faster?"
.IX Subsection "How can I make my Perl program run faster?"
The best way to do this is to come up with a better algorithm.  This
can often make a dramatic difference.  Jon Bentley's book
\&\fIProgramming Pearls\fR (that's not a misspelling!)  has some good tips
on optimization, too.  Advice on benchmarking boils down to: benchmark
and profile to make sure you're optimizing the right part, look for
better algorithms instead of microtuning your code, and when all else
fails consider just buying faster hardware.  You will probably want to
read the answer to the earlier question \*(L"How do I profile my Perl
programs?\*(R" if you haven't done so already.
.PP
A different approach is to autoload seldom-used Perl code.  See the
AutoSplit and AutoLoader modules in the standard distribution for
that.  Or you could locate the bottleneck and think about writing just
that part in C, the way we used to take bottlenecks in C code and
write them in assembler.  Similar to rewriting in C, modules that have
critical sections can be written in C (for instance, the \s-1PDL\s0 module
from \s-1CPAN\s0).
.PP
If you're currently linking your perl executable to a shared
\&\fIlibc.so\fR, you can often gain a 10\-25% performance benefit by
rebuilding it to link with a static libc.a instead.  This will make a
bigger perl executable, but your Perl programs (and programmers) may
thank you for it.  See the \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR file in the source distribution
for more information.
.PP
The undump program was an ancient attempt to speed up Perl program by
storing the already-compiled form to disk.  This is no longer a viable
option, as it only worked on a few architectures, and wasn't a good
solution anyway.
.Sh "How can I make my Perl program take less memory?"
.IX Subsection "How can I make my Perl program take less memory?"
When it comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly always prefers to
throw memory at a problem.  Scalars in Perl use more memory than
strings in C, arrays take more than that, and hashes use even more.  While
there's still a lot to be done, recent releases have been addressing
these issues.  For example, as of 5.004, duplicate hash keys are
shared amongst all hashes using them, so require no reallocation.
.PP
In some cases, using \fIsubstr()\fR or \fIvec()\fR to simulate arrays can be
highly beneficial.  For example, an array of a thousand booleans will
take at least 20,000 bytes of space, but it can be turned into one
125\-byte bit vector\*(--a considerable memory savings.  The standard
Tie::SubstrHash module can also help for certain types of data
structure.  If you're working with specialist data structures
(matrices, for instance) modules that implement these in C may use
less memory than equivalent Perl modules.
.PP
Another thing to try is learning whether your Perl was compiled with
the system malloc or with Perl's builtin malloc.  Whichever one it
is, try using the other one and see whether this makes a difference.
Information about malloc is in the \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR file in the source
distribution.  You can find out whether you are using perl's malloc by
typing \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V:usemymalloc\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Of course, the best way to save memory is to not do anything to waste
it in the first place. Good programming practices can go a long way
toward this:
.IP "* Don't slurp!" 4
.IX Item "Don't slurp!"
Don't read an entire file into memory if you can process it line
by line. Or more concretely, use a loop like this:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        #
\&        # Good Idea
\&        #
\&        while (<FILE>) {
\&           # ...
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
instead of this:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        #
\&        # Bad Idea
\&        #
\&        @data = <FILE>;
\&        foreach (@data) {
\&            # ...
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
When the files you're processing are small, it doesn't much matter which
way you do it, but it makes a huge difference when they start getting
larger.
.IP "* Use map and grep selectively" 4
.IX Item "Use map and grep selectively"
Remember that both map and grep expect a \s-1LIST\s0 argument, so doing this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        @wanted = grep {/pattern/} <FILE>;
.Ve
.Sp
will cause the entire file to be slurped. For large files, it's better
to loop:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        while (<FILE>) {
\&                push(@wanted, $_) if /pattern/;
\&        }
.Ve
.IP "* Avoid unnecessary quotes and stringification" 4
.IX Item "Avoid unnecessary quotes and stringification"
Don't quote large strings unless absolutely necessary:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        my $copy = "$large_string";
.Ve
.Sp
makes 2 copies of \f(CW$large_string\fR (one for \f(CW$copy\fR and another for the
quotes), whereas
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        my $copy = $large_string;
.Ve
.Sp
only makes one copy.
.Sp
Ditto for stringifying large arrays:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        {
\&                local $, = "\en";
\&                print @big_array;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
is much more memory-efficient than either
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        print join "\en", @big_array;
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        {
\&                local $" = "\en";
\&                print "@big_array";
\&        }
.Ve
.IP "* Pass by reference" 4
.IX Item "Pass by reference"
Pass arrays and hashes by reference, not by value. For one thing, it's
the only way to pass multiple lists or hashes (or both) in a single
call/return. It also avoids creating a copy of all the contents. This
requires some judgment, however, because any changes will be propagated
back to the original data. If you really want to mangle (er, modify) a
copy, you'll have to sacrifice the memory needed to make one.
.IP "* Tie large variables to disk." 4
.IX Item "Tie large variables to disk."
For \*(L"big\*(R" data stores (i.e. ones that exceed available memory) consider
using one of the \s-1DB\s0 modules to store it on disk instead of in \s-1RAM\s0. This
will incur a penalty in access time, but that's probably better than
causing your hard disk to thrash due to massive swapping.

You usually can't. Memory allocated to lexicals (i.e. \fImy()\fR variables)
cannot be reclaimed or reused even if they go out of scope. It is
reserved in case the variables come back into scope. Memory allocated
to global variables can be reused (within your program) by using
\&\fIundef()\fRing and/or \fIdelete()\fR.
.PP
On most operating systems, memory allocated to a program can never be
returned to the system. That's why long-running programs sometimes re\-
exec themselves. Some operating systems (notably, systems that use
\&\fImmap\fR\|(2) for allocating large chunks of memory) can reclaim memory that
is no longer used, but on such systems, perl must be configured and
compiled to use the \s-1OS\s0's malloc, not perl's.
.PP
In general, memory allocation and de-allocation isn't something you can
or should be worrying about much in Perl.
.PP
See also \*(L"How can I make my Perl program take less memory?\*(R"
.Sh "How can I make my \s-1CGI\s0 script more efficient?"
.IX Subsection "How can I make my CGI script more efficient?"
Beyond the normal measures described to make general Perl programs
faster or smaller, a \s-1CGI\s0 program has additional issues.  It may be run
several times per second.  Given that each time it runs it will need
to be re-compiled and will often allocate a megabyte or more of system
memory, this can be a killer.  Compiling into C \fBisn't going to help
you\fR because the process start-up overhead is where the bottleneck is.
.PP
There are two popular ways to avoid this overhead.  One solution
involves running the Apache \s-1HTTP\s0 server (available from
http://www.apache.org/ ) with either of the mod_perl or mod_fastcgi
plugin modules.
.PP
With mod_perl and the Apache::Registry module (distributed with
mod_perl), httpd will run with an embedded Perl interpreter which
pre-compiles your script and then executes it within the same address
space without forking.  The Apache extension also gives Perl access to
the internal server \s-1API\s0, so modules written in Perl can do just about
anything a module written in C can.  For more on mod_perl, see
http://perl.apache.org/
.PP
With the \s-1FCGI\s0 module (from \s-1CPAN\s0) and the mod_fastcgi
module (available from http://www.fastcgi.com/ ) each of your Perl
programs becomes a permanent \s-1CGI\s0 daemon process.
.PP
Both of these solutions can have far-reaching effects on your system
and on the way you write your \s-1CGI\s0 programs, so investigate them with
care.
.PP

.Sh "How can I hide the source for my Perl program?"
.IX Subsection "How can I hide the source for my Perl program?"
Delete it. :\-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly
unsatisfactory) solutions with varying levels of \*(L"security\*(R".
.PP
First of all, however, you \fIcan't\fR take away read permission, because
the source code has to be readable in order to be compiled and
interpreted.  (That doesn't mean that a \s-1CGI\s0 script's source is
readable by people on the web, though\*(--only by people with access to
the filesystem.)  So you have to leave the permissions at the socially
friendly 0755 level.
.PP
Some people regard this as a security problem.  If your program does
insecure things and relies on people not knowing how to exploit those
insecurities, it is not secure.  It is often possible for someone to
determine the insecure things and exploit them without viewing the
source.  Security through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs
instead of fixing them, is little security indeed.
.PP
You can try using encryption via source filters (Starting from Perl
5.8 the Filter::Simple and Filter::Util::Call modules are included in
the standard distribution), but any decent programmer will be able to
decrypt it.  You can try using the byte code compiler and interpreter
described below, but the curious might still be able to de-compile it.
You can try using the native-code compiler described below, but
crackers might be able to disassemble it.  These pose varying degrees
of difficulty to people wanting to get at your code, but none can
definitively conceal it (true of every language, not just Perl).
.PP
It is very easy to recover the source of Perl programs.  You simply
feed the program to the perl interpreter and use the modules in
the B:: hierarchy.  The B::Deparse module should be able to
defeat most attempts to hide source.  Again, this is not
unique to Perl.
.PP
If you're concerned about people profiting from your code, then the
bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive license will give you
legal security.  License your software and pepper it with threatening
statements like \*(L"This is unpublished proprietary software of \s-1XYZ\s0 Corp.
Your access to it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.\*(R"  We are not lawyers, of course, so you should see a lawyer if
you want to be sure your license's wording will stand up in court.

In general, you can't do this.  There are some things that may work
for your situation though.  People usually ask this question
because they want to distribute their works without giving away
the source code, and most solutions trade disk space for convenience.

solutions simply bundle a Perl interpreter in the final product

.Sh "Why don't Perl one-liners work on my DOS/Mac/VMS system?"
.IX Subsection "Why don't Perl one-liners work on my DOS/Mac/VMS system?"
The problem is usually that the command interpreters on those systems
have rather different ideas about quoting than the Unix shells under
which the one-liners were created.  On some systems, you may have to
change single-quotes to double ones, which you must \fI\s-1NOT\s0\fR do on Unix
or Plan9 systems.  You might also have to change a single % to a %%.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # Unix
\&    perl -e 'print "Hello world\en"'
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # DOS, etc.
\&    perl -e "print \e"Hello world\en\e""
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # Mac
\&    print "Hello world\en"
\&     (then Run "Myscript" or Shift-Command-R)
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # MPW
\&    perl -e 'print "Hello world\en"'
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # VMS
\&    perl -e "print ""Hello world\en"""
.Ve
.PP
The problem is that none of these examples are reliable: they depend on the
command interpreter.  Under Unix, the first two often work. Under \s-1DOS\s0,
it's entirely possible that neither works.  If 4DOS was the command shell,
you'd probably have better luck like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perl -e "print <Ctrl-x>"Hello world\en<Ctrl-x>""
.Ve
.PP
Under the Mac, it depends which environment you are using.  The MacPerl
shell, or \s-1MPW\s0, is much like Unix shells in its support for several
quoting variants, except that it makes free use of the Mac's non-ASCII
characters as control characters.
