.SH OVERVIEW
Subversion is a version control system, which allows you to keep old
versions of files and directories (usually source code), keep a log of
who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS.
\fBSubversion\fP keeps a single copy of the master sources.  This copy
is called the source ``repository''; it contains all the information
to permit extracting previous versions of those files at any time.

explanations of the \fBsvn\fP, \fBsvnadmin\fP, \fBsvnserve\fP and

approaches and reasonings, etc., can be found at
