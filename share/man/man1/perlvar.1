.IX Title "PERLVAR 1"
.TH PERLVAR 1 "2006-01-07" "perl v5.8.8" "Perl Programmers Reference Guide"
.SH "NAME"
perlvar \- Perl predefined variables
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.Sh "Predefined Names"
.IX Subsection "Predefined Names"
The following names have special meaning to Perl.  Most 
punctuation names have reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the
shells.  Nevertheless, if you wish to use long variable names,
you need only say
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use English;
.Ve
.PP
at the top of your program. This aliases all the short names to the long
names in the current package. Some even have medium names, generally
borrowed from \fBawk\fR. In general, it's best to use the
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use English '-no_match_vars';
.Ve
.PP
invocation if you don't need \f(CW$PREMATCH\fR, \f(CW$MATCH\fR, or \f(CW$POSTMATCH\fR, as it avoids
a certain performance hit with the use of regular expressions. See
English.
.PP
Variables that depend on the currently selected filehandle may be set by
calling an appropriate object method on the IO::Handle object, although
this is less efficient than using the regular built-in variables. (Summary
lines below for this contain the word \s-1HANDLE\s0.) First you must say
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use IO::Handle;
.Ve
.PP
after which you may use either
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    method HANDLE EXPR
.Ve
.PP
or more safely,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    HANDLE->method(EXPR)
.Ve
.PP
Each method returns the old value of the IO::Handle attribute.
The methods each take an optional \s-1EXPR\s0, which, if supplied, specifies the
new value for the IO::Handle attribute in question.  If not supplied,
most methods do nothing to the current value\*(--except for
\&\fIautoflush()\fR, which will assume a 1 for you, just to be different.
.PP
Because loading in the IO::Handle class is an expensive operation, you should
learn how to use the regular built-in variables.
.PP
A few of these variables are considered \*(L"read\-only\*(R".  This means that if
you try to assign to this variable, either directly or indirectly through
a reference, you'll raise a run-time exception.
.PP
You should be very careful when modifying the default values of most
special variables described in this document. In most cases you want
to localize these variables before changing them, since if you don't,
the change may affect other modules which rely on the default values
of the special variables that you have changed. This is one of the
correct ways to read the whole file at once:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    open my $fh, "foo" or die $!;
\&    local $/; # enable localized slurp mode
\&    my $content = <$fh>;
\&    close $fh;
.Ve
.PP
But the following code is quite bad:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    open my $fh, "foo" or die $!;
\&    undef $/; # enable slurp mode
\&    my $content = <$fh>;
\&    close $fh;
.Ve
.PP
since some other module, may want to read data from some file in the
default \*(L"line mode\*(R", so if the code we have just presented has been
executed, the global value of \f(CW$/\fR is now changed for any other code
running inside the same Perl interpreter.
.PP
Usually when a variable is localized you want to make sure that this
change affects the shortest scope possible. So unless you are already
inside some short \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR block, you should create one yourself. For
example:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    my $content = '';
\&    open my $fh, "foo" or die $!;
\&    {
\&        local $/;
\&        $content = <$fh>;
\&    }
\&    close $fh;
.Ve
.PP
Here is an example of how your own code can go broken:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    for (1..5){
\&        nasty_break();
\&        print "$_ ";
\&    }
\&    sub nasty_break {
\&        $_ = 5;
\&        # do something with $_
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
You probably expect this code to print:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    1 2 3 4 5
.Ve
.PP
but instead you get:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    5 5 5 5 5
.Ve
.PP
Why? Because \fInasty_break()\fR modifies \f(CW$_\fR without localizing it
first. The fix is to add \fIlocal()\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        local $_ = 5;
.Ve
.PP
It's easy to notice the problem in such a short example, but in more
complicated code you are looking for trouble if you don't localize
changes to the special variables.
.PP
The following list is ordered by scalar variables first, then the
arrays, then the hashes.
.IP "$ARG" 8
.IX Item "$ARG"
.PD 0
.IP "$_" 8
.IX Item "$_"
.PD
The default input and pattern-searching space.  The following pairs are
equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    while (<>) {...}    # equivalent only in while!
\&    while (defined($_ = <>)) {...}
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    /^Subject:/
\&    $_ =~ /^Subject:/
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    tr/a-z/A-Z/
\&    $_ =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/
.Ve
.Sp

Here are the places where Perl will assume \f(CW$_\fR even if you
don't use it:
.RS 8
.IP "*" 3
Various unary functions, including functions like \fIord()\fR and \fIint()\fR, as well
as the all file tests (\f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR) except for \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR, which defaults to
\&\s-1STDIN\s0.
.IP "*" 3
Various list functions like \fIprint()\fR and \fIunlink()\fR.
.IP "*" 3
The pattern matching operations \f(CW\*(C`m//\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`tr///\*(C'\fR when used
without an \f(CW\*(C`=~\*(C'\fR operator.
.IP "*" 3
The default iterator variable in a \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR loop if no other
variable is supplied.
.IP "*" 3
The implicit iterator variable in the \fIgrep()\fR and \fImap()\fR functions.
.IP "*" 3
The default place to put an input record when a \f(CW\*(C`<FH>\*(C'\fR
operation's result is tested by itself as the sole criterion of a \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR
test.  Outside a \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR test, this will not happen.
.RE
.RS 8
.Sp
(Mnemonic: underline is understood in certain operations.)
.RE
.IP "$a" 8
.IX Item "$a"
.PD 0
.IP "$b" 8
.IX Item "$b"
.PD
Special package variables when using \fIsort()\fR, see \*(L"sort\*(R" in perlfunc.
Because of this specialness \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR don't need to be declared
(using use vars, or \fIour()\fR) even when using the \f(CW\*(C`strict 'vars'\*(C'\fR pragma.
Don't lexicalize them with \f(CW\*(C`my $a\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`my $b\*(C'\fR if you want to be
able to use them in the \fIsort()\fR comparison block or function.
.IP "$<\fIdigits\fR>" 8
.IX Item "$<digits>"
Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set of capturing
parentheses from the last pattern match, not counting patterns
matched in nested blocks that have been exited already.  (Mnemonic:
like \edigits.)  These variables are all read-only and dynamically
scoped to the current \s-1BLOCK\s0.
.IP "$MATCH" 8
.IX Item "$MATCH"
.PD 0
.IP "$&" 8
.PD
The string matched by the last successful pattern match (not counting
any matches hidden within a \s-1BLOCK\s0 or \fIeval()\fR enclosed by the current
\&\s-1BLOCK\s0).  (Mnemonic: like & in some editors.)  This variable is read-only
and dynamically scoped to the current \s-1BLOCK\s0.
.Sp
The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a considerable
performance penalty on all regular expression matches.  See \*(L"\s-1BUGS\s0\*(R".
.IP "$PREMATCH" 8
.IX Item "$PREMATCH"
.PD 0
.IP "$`" 8
.PD
The string preceding whatever was matched by the last successful
pattern match (not counting any matches hidden within a \s-1BLOCK\s0 or eval
enclosed by the current \s-1BLOCK\s0).  (Mnemonic: \f(CW\*(C``\*(C'\fR often precedes a quoted
string.)  This variable is read\-only.
.Sp
The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a considerable
performance penalty on all regular expression matches.  See \*(L"\s-1BUGS\s0\*(R".
.IP "$POSTMATCH" 8
.IX Item "$POSTMATCH"
.PD 0
.IP "$'" 8
.PD
The string following whatever was matched by the last successful
pattern match (not counting any matches hidden within a \s-1BLOCK\s0 or \fIeval()\fR
enclosed by the current \s-1BLOCK\s0).  (Mnemonic: \f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR often follows a quoted
string.)  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    local $_ = 'abcdefghi';
\&    /def/;
\&    print "$`:$&:$'\en";         # prints abc:def:ghi
.Ve
.Sp
This variable is read-only and dynamically scoped to the current \s-1BLOCK\s0.
.Sp
The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a considerable
performance penalty on all regular expression matches.  See \*(L"\s-1BUGS\s0\*(R".
.IP "$LAST_PAREN_MATCH" 8
.IX Item "$LAST_PAREN_MATCH"
.PD 0
.IP "$+" 8
.PD
The text matched by the last bracket of the last successful search pattern.
This is useful if you don't know which one of a set of alternative patterns
matched. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    /Version: (.*)|Revision: (.*)/ && ($rev = $+);
.Ve
.Sp
(Mnemonic: be positive and forward looking.)
This variable is read-only and dynamically scoped to the current \s-1BLOCK\s0.
.IP "$^N" 8
.IX Item "$^N"
The text matched by the used group most-recently closed (i.e. the group
with the rightmost closing parenthesis) of the last successful search
pattern.  (Mnemonic: the (possibly) Nested parenthesis that most
recently closed.)
.Sp
This is primarily used inside \f(CW\*(C`(?{...})\*(C'\fR blocks for examining text
recently matched. For example, to effectively capture text to a variable
(in addition to \f(CW$1\fR, \f(CW$2\fR, etc.), replace \f(CW\*(C`(...)\*(C'\fR with
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     (?:(...)(?{ $var = $^N }))
.Ve
.Sp
By setting and then using \f(CW$var\fR in this way relieves you from having to
worry about exactly which numbered set of parentheses they are.
.Sp
This variable is dynamically scoped to the current \s-1BLOCK\s0.
.IP "@LAST_MATCH_END" 8
.IX Item "@LAST_MATCH_END"
.PD 0
.IP "@+" 8
.PD
This array holds the offsets of the ends of the last successful
submatches in the currently active dynamic scope.  \f(CW$+[0]\fR is
the offset into the string of the end of the entire match.  This
is the same value as what the \f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR function returns when called
on the variable that was matched against.  The \fIn\fRth element
of this array holds the offset of the \fIn\fRth submatch, so
\&\f(CW$+[1]\fR is the offset past where \f(CW$1\fR ends, \f(CW$+[2]\fR the offset
past where \f(CW$2\fR ends, and so on.  You can use \f(CW$#+\fR to determine
how many subgroups were in the last successful match.  See the
examples given for the \f(CW\*(C`@\-\*(C'\fR variable.
.IP "$*" 8
Set to a non-zero integer value to do multi-line matching within a
string, 0 (or undefined) to tell Perl that it can assume that strings
contain a single line, for the purpose of optimizing pattern matches.
Pattern matches on strings containing multiple newlines can produce
confusing results when \f(CW$*\fR is 0 or undefined. Default is undefined.
(Mnemonic: * matches multiple things.) This variable influences the
interpretation of only \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR. A literal newline can be searched
for even when \f(CW\*(C`$* == 0\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Use of \f(CW$*\fR is deprecated in modern Perl, supplanted by 
the \f(CW\*(C`/s\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`/m\*(C'\fR modifiers on pattern matching.
.Sp
Assigning a non-numerical value to \f(CW$*\fR triggers a warning (and makes
\&\f(CW$*\fR act if \f(CW\*(C`$* == 0\*(C'\fR), while assigning a numerical value to \f(CW$*\fR
makes that an implicit \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR is applied on the value.
.IP "\s-1HANDLE\-\s0>input_line_number(\s-1EXPR\s0)" 8
.IX Item "HANDLE->input_line_number(EXPR)"
.PD 0
.IP "$INPUT_LINE_NUMBER" 8
.IX Item "$INPUT_LINE_NUMBER"
.IP "$NR" 8
.IX Item "$NR"
.IP "$." 8
.PD
Current line number for the last filehandle accessed. 
.Sp
Each filehandle in Perl counts the number of lines that have been read
from it.  (Depending on the value of \f(CW$/\fR, Perl's idea of what
constitutes a line may not match yours.)  When a line is read from a
filehandle (via \fIreadline()\fR or \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR), or when \fItell()\fR or \fIseek()\fR is
called on it, \f(CW$.\fR becomes an alias to the line counter for that
filehandle.
.Sp
You can adjust the counter by assigning to \f(CW$.\fR, but this will not
actually move the seek pointer.  \fILocalizing \f(CI$.\fI will not localize
the filehandle's line count\fR.  Instead, it will localize perl's notion
of which filehandle \f(CW$.\fR is currently aliased to.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$.\fR is reset when the filehandle is closed, but \fBnot\fR when an open
filehandle is reopened without an intervening \fIclose()\fR.  For more
details, see "I/O Operators" in perlop.  Because \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR never does
an explicit close, line numbers increase across \s-1ARGV\s0 files (but see
examples in \*(L"eof\*(R" in perlfunc).
.Sp
You can also use \f(CW\*(C`HANDLE\->input_line_number(EXPR)\*(C'\fR to access the
line counter for a given filehandle without having to worry about
which handle you last accessed.
.Sp
(Mnemonic: many programs use \*(L".\*(R" to mean the current line number.)
.IP "IO::Handle\->input_record_separator(\s-1EXPR\s0)" 8
.IX Item "IO::Handle->input_record_separator(EXPR)"
.PD 0
.IP "$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR" 8
.IX Item "$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR"
.IP "$RS" 8
.IX Item "$RS"
.IP "$/" 8
.PD
The input record separator, newline by default.  This 
influences Perl's idea of what a \*(L"line\*(R" is.  Works like \fBawk\fR's \s-1RS\s0
variable, including treating empty lines as a terminator if set to
the null string.  (An empty line cannot contain any spaces
or tabs.)  You may set it to a multi-character string to match a
multi-character terminator, or to \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR to read through the end
of file.  Setting it to \f(CW"\en\en"\fR means something slightly
different than setting to \f(CW""\fR, if the file contains consecutive
empty lines.  Setting to \f(CW""\fR will treat two or more consecutive
empty lines as a single empty line.  Setting to \f(CW"\en\en"\fR will
blindly assume that the next input character belongs to the next
paragraph, even if it's a newline.  (Mnemonic: / delimits
line boundaries when quoting poetry.)
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    local $/;           # enable "slurp" mode
\&    local $_ = <FH>;    # whole file now here
\&    s/\en[ \et]+/ /g;
.Ve
.Sp
Remember: the value of \f(CW$/\fR is a string, not a regex.  \fBawk\fR has to be
better for something. :\-)
.Sp
Setting \f(CW$/\fR to a reference to an integer, scalar containing an integer, or
scalar that's convertible to an integer will attempt to read records
instead of lines, with the maximum record size being the referenced
integer.  So this:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    local $/ = \e32768; # or \e"32768", or \e$var_containing_32768
\&    open my $fh, $myfile or die $!;
\&    local $_ = <$fh>;
.Ve
.Sp
will read a record of no more than 32768 bytes from \s-1FILE\s0.  If you're
not reading from a record-oriented file (or your \s-1OS\s0 doesn't have
record-oriented files), then you'll likely get a full chunk of data
with every read.  If a record is larger than the record size you've
set, you'll get the record back in pieces.
.Sp
On \s-1VMS\s0, record reads are done with the equivalent of \f(CW\*(C`sysread\*(C'\fR,
so it's best not to mix record and non-record reads on the same
file.  (This is unlikely to be a problem, because any file you'd
want to read in record mode is probably unusable in line mode.)
Non-VMS systems do normal I/O, so it's safe to mix record and
non-record reads of a file.
.Sp
See also \*(L"Newlines\*(R" in perlport.  Also see \f(CW$.\fR.

.PD
If set to nonzero, forces a flush right away and after every write
or print on the currently selected output channel.  Default is 0
(regardless of whether the channel is really buffered by the
system or not; \f(CW$|\fR tells you only whether you've asked Perl
explicitly to flush after each write).  \s-1STDOUT\s0 will
typically be line buffered if output is to the terminal and block
buffered otherwise.  Setting this variable is useful primarily when
you are outputting to a pipe or socket, such as when you are running
a Perl program under \fBrsh\fR and want to see the output as it's
happening.  This has no effect on input buffering.  See \*(L"getc\*(R" in perlfunc
for that.  (Mnemonic: when you want your pipes to be piping hot.)

.IP "$#" 8
The output format for printed numbers.  This variable is a half-hearted
attempt to emulate \fBawk\fR's \s-1OFMT\s0 variable.  There are times, however,
when \fBawk\fR and Perl have differing notions of what counts as 
numeric.  The initial value is "%.\fIn\fRg", where \fIn\fR is the value
of the macro \s-1DBL_DIG\s0 from your system's \fIfloat.h\fR.  This is different from
\&\fBawk\fR's default \s-1OFMT\s0 setting of \*(L"%.6g\*(R", so you need to set \f(CW$#\fR

The status returned by the last pipe close, backtick (\f(CW``\fR) command,
successful call to \fIwait()\fR or \fIwaitpid()\fR, or from the \fIsystem()\fR
operator.  This is just the 16\-bit status word returned by the

exit value of the subprocess is really (\f(CW\*(C`$? >> 8\*(C'\fR), and
\&\f(CW\*(C`$? & 127\*(C'\fR gives which signal, if any, the process died from, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`$? & 128\*(C'\fR reports whether there was a core dump.  (Mnemonic:
similar to \fBsh\fR and \fBksh\fR.)
.Sp
Additionally, if the \f(CW\*(C`h_errno\*(C'\fR variable is supported in C, its value

.Sp
If you have installed a signal handler for \f(CW\*(C`SIGCHLD\*(C'\fR, the
value of \f(CW$?\fR will usually be wrong outside that handler.
.Sp
Inside an \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR subroutine \f(CW$?\fR contains the value that is going to be
given to \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR.  You can modify \f(CW$?\fR in an \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR subroutine to
change the exit status of your program.  For example:

Error information specific to the current operating system.  At

(and for MacPerl).  On all other platforms, \f(CW$^E\fR is always just
the same as \f(CW$!\fR.
.Sp
Under \s-1VMS\s0, \f(CW$^E\fR provides the \s-1VMS\s0 status value from the last
system error.  This is more specific information about the last
system error than that provided by \f(CW$!\fR.  This is particularly
important when \f(CW$!\fR is set to \fB\s-1EVMSERR\s0\fR.

Under \s-1OS/2\s0, \f(CW$^E\fR is set to the error code of the last call to
\&\s-1OS/2\s0 \s-1API\s0 either via \s-1CRT\s0, or directly from perl.
.Sp
Under Win32, \f(CW$^E\fR always returns the last error information
reported by the Win32 call \f(CW\*(C`GetLastError()\*(C'\fR which describes
the last error from within the Win32 \s-1API\s0.  Most Win32\-specific
code will report errors via \f(CW$^E\fR.  \s-1ANSI\s0 C and Unix-like calls
set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR and so most portable Perl code will report errors

On some (read: not all) operating systems assigning to \f(CW$0\fR modifies
the argument area that the \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR program sees.  On some platforms you
may have to use special \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR options or a different \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR to see the
changes.  Modifying the \f(CW$0\fR is more useful as a way of indicating the
current program state than it is for hiding the program you're
running.  (Mnemonic: same as \fBsh\fR and \fBksh\fR.)
.Sp
Note that there are platform specific limitations on the maximum
length of \f(CW$0\fR.  In the most extreme case it may be limited to the
space occupied by the original \f(CW$0\fR.
.Sp
In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding, for
example space characters, after the modified name as shown by \f(CW\*(C`ps\*(C'\fR.
In some platforms this padding may extend all the way to the original
length of the argument area, no matter what you do (this is the case
for example with Linux 2.2).
.Sp
Note for \s-1BSD\s0 users: setting \f(CW$0\fR does not completely remove \*(L"perl\*(R"
from the \fIps\fR\|(1) output.  For example, setting \f(CW$0\fR to \f(CW"foobar"\fR may
result in \f(CW"perl: foobar (perl)"\fR (whether both the \f(CW"perl: "\fR prefix
and the \*(L" (perl)\*(R" suffix are shown depends on your exact \s-1BSD\s0 variant
and version).  This is an operating system feature, Perl cannot help it.
.Sp
In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that any
thread may modify its copy of the \f(CW$0\fR and the change becomes visible
to \fIps\fR\|(1) (assuming the operating system plays along).  Note that
the view of \f(CW$0\fR the other threads have will not change since they
have their own copies of it.
.IP "$[" 8
The index of the first element in an array, and of the first character
in a substring.  Default is 0, but you could theoretically set it
to 1 to make Perl behave more like \fBawk\fR (or Fortran) when
subscripting and when evaluating the \fIindex()\fR and \fIsubstr()\fR functions.
(Mnemonic: [ begins subscripts.)
.Sp
As of release 5 of Perl, assignment to \f(CW$[\fR is treated as a compiler
directive, and cannot influence the behavior of any other file.
(That's why you can only assign compile-time constants to it.)
Its use is highly discouraged.
.Sp
Note that, unlike other compile-time directives (such as strict),
assignment to \f(CW$[\fR can be seen from outer lexical scopes in the same file.
However, you can use \fIlocal()\fR on it to strictly bind its value to a
lexical block.
.IP "$]" 8
The version + patchlevel / 1000 of the Perl interpreter.  This variable
can be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter executing a
script is in the right range of versions.  (Mnemonic: Is this version
of perl in the right bracket?)  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sp
See also the documentation of \f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`require VERSION\*(C'\fR
for a convenient way to fail if the running Perl interpreter is too old.
.Sp
When testing the variable, to steer clear of floating point
inaccuracies you might want to prefer the inequality tests \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR to the tests containing equivalence: \f(CW\*(C`<=\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`==\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`>=\*(C'\fR.

\&\f(CW\*(C`$^C = 1\*(C'\fR is similar to calling \f(CW\*(C`B::minus_c\*(C'\fR.
.IP "$DEBUGGING" 8

The current value of the debugging flags.  (Mnemonic: value of \fB\-D\fR
switch.) May be read or set. Like its command-line equivalent, you can use
numeric or symbolic values, eg \f(CW\*(C`$^D = 10\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`$^D = "st"\*(C'\fR.
.IP "$SYSTEM_FD_MAX" 8

The maximum system file descriptor, ordinarily 2.  System file
descriptors are passed to \fIexec()\fRed processes, while higher file
descriptors are not.  Also, during an \fIopen()\fR, system file descriptors are
preserved even if the \fIopen()\fR fails.  (Ordinary file descriptors are
closed before the \fIopen()\fR is attempted.)  The close-on-exec
status of a file descriptor will be decided according to the value of
\&\f(CW$^F\fR when the corresponding file, pipe, or socket was opened, not the
time of the \fIexec()\fR.
.IP "$^H" 8
.IX Item "$^H"
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 This variable is strictly for internal use only.  Its availability,
behavior, and contents are subject to change without notice.
.Sp
This variable contains compile-time hints for the Perl interpreter.  At the
end of compilation of a \s-1BLOCK\s0 the value of this variable is restored to the
value when the interpreter started to compile the \s-1BLOCK\s0.
.Sp
When perl begins to parse any block construct that provides a lexical scope
(e.g., eval body, required file, subroutine body, loop body, or conditional
block), the existing value of $^H is saved, but its value is left unchanged.
When the compilation of the block is completed, it regains the saved value.
Between the points where its value is saved and restored, code that
executes within \s-1BEGIN\s0 blocks is free to change the value of $^H.
.Sp
This behavior provides the semantic of lexical scoping, and is used in,
for instance, the \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR pragma.
.Sp
The contents should be an integer; different bits of it are used for
different pragmatic flags.  Here's an example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100 }
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    sub foo {
\&        BEGIN { add_100() }
\&        bar->baz($boon);
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
Consider what happens during execution of the \s-1BEGIN\s0 block.  At this point
the \s-1BEGIN\s0 block has already been compiled, but the body of \fIfoo()\fR is still
being compiled.  The new value of $^H will therefore be visible only while
the body of \fIfoo()\fR is being compiled.
.Sp
Substitution of the above \s-1BEGIN\s0 block with:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    BEGIN { require strict; strict->import('vars') }
.Ve
.Sp
demonstrates how \f(CW\*(C`use strict 'vars'\*(C'\fR is implemented.  Here's a conditional
version of the same lexical pragma:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    BEGIN { require strict; strict->import('vars') if $condition }
.Ve
.IP "%^H" 8
.IX Item "%^H"
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 This variable is strictly for internal use only.  Its availability,
behavior, and contents are subject to change without notice.
.Sp
The %^H hash provides the same scoping semantic as $^H.  This makes it
useful for implementation of lexically scoped pragmas.
.IP "$INPLACE_EDIT" 8

The current value of the inplace-edit extension.  Use \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR to disable
inplace editing.  (Mnemonic: value of \fB\-i\fR switch.)
.IP "$^M" 8
.IX Item "$^M"
By default, running out of memory is an untrappable, fatal error.
However, if suitably built, Perl can use the contents of \f(CW$^M\fR
as an emergency memory pool after \fIdie()\fRing.  Suppose that your Perl
were compiled with \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK\*(C'\fR and used Perl's malloc.
Then
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $^M = 'a' x (1 << 16);
.Ve
.Sp
would allocate a 64K buffer for use in an emergency.  See the
\&\fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR file in the Perl distribution for information on how to
add custom C compilation flags when compiling perl.  To discourage casual
use of this advanced feature, there is no English long name for
this variable.
.IP "$OSNAME" 8

.PD 0
.IP "$^O" 8

is identical to \f(CW$Config{'osname'}\fR.  See also Config and the 
\&\fB\-V\fR command-line switch documented in perlrun.
.Sp
In Windows platforms, $^O is not very helpful: since it is always
\&\f(CW\*(C`MSWin32\*(C'\fR, it doesn't tell the difference between
95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/CE/.NET.  Use \fIWin32::GetOSName()\fR or

The revision, version, and subversion of the Perl interpreter, represented
as a string composed of characters with those ordinals.  Thus in Perl v5.6.0
it equals \f(CW\*(C`chr(5) . chr(6) . chr(0)\*(C'\fR and will return true for
\&\f(CW\*(C`$^V eq v5.6.0\*(C'\fR.  Note that the characters in this string value can
potentially be in Unicode range.
.Sp
This can be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter executing a
script is in the right range of versions.  (Mnemonic: use ^V for Version
Control.)  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    warn "No \e"our\e" declarations!\en" if $^V and $^V lt v5.6.0;
.Ve
.Sp
To convert \f(CW$^V\fR into its string representation use \fIsprintf()\fR's
\&\f(CW"%vd"\fR conversion:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    printf "version is v%vd\en", $^V;  # Perl's version

.IP "$EXECUTABLE_NAME" 8

.PD
The name used to execute the current copy of Perl, from C's
\&\f(CW\*(C`argv[0]\*(C'\fR or (where supported) \fI/proc/self/exe\fR.
.Sp
Depending on the host operating system, the value of $^X may be
a relative or absolute pathname of the perl program file, or may
be the string used to invoke perl but not the pathname of the
perl program file.  Also, most operating systems permit invoking
programs that are not in the \s-1PATH\s0 environment variable, so there
is no guarantee that the value of $^X is in \s-1PATH\s0.  For \s-1VMS\s0, the
value may or may not include a version number.
.Sp
You usually can use the value of $^X to re-invoke an independent
copy of the same perl that is currently running, e.g.,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  @first_run = `$^X -le "print int rand 100 for 1..100"`;
.Ve
.Sp
But recall that not all operating systems support forking or
capturing of the output of commands, so this complex statement
may not be portable.
.Sp
It is not safe to use the value of $^X as a path name of a file,
as some operating systems that have a mandatory suffix on
executable files do not require use of the suffix when invoking
a command.  To convert the value of $^X to a path name, use the
following statements:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  # Build up a set of file names (not command names).
\&  use Config;
\&  $this_perl = $^X;
\&  if ($^O ne 'VMS')
\&     {$this_perl .= $Config{_exe}
\&          unless $this_perl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}
.Ve
.Sp
Because many operating systems permit anyone with read access to
the Perl program file to make a copy of it, patch the copy, and
then execute the copy, the security-conscious Perl programmer
should take care to invoke the installed copy of perl, not the
copy referenced by $^X.  The following statements accomplish
this goal, and produce a pathname that can be invoked as a
command or referenced as a file.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  use Config;
\&  $secure_perl_path = $Config{perlpath};
\&  if ($^O ne 'VMS')
\&     {$secure_perl_path .= $Config{_exe}
\&          unless $secure_perl_path =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}

.IP "\s-1ARGV\s0" 8
.IX Item "ARGV"
The special filehandle that iterates over command-line filenames in
\&\f(CW@ARGV\fR. Usually written as the null filehandle in the angle operator
\&\f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR. Note that currently \f(CW\*(C`ARGV\*(C'\fR only has its magical effect
within the \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR operator; elsewhere it is just a plain filehandle
corresponding to the last file opened by \f(CW\*(C`<>\*(C'\fR. In particular,
passing \f(CW\*(C`\e*ARGV\*(C'\fR as a parameter to a function that expects a filehandle
may not cause your function to automatically read the contents of all the
files in \f(CW@ARGV\fR.
.IP "$ARGV" 8
.IX Item "$ARGV"
contains the name of the current file when reading from <>.
.IP "@ARGV" 8
.IX Item "@ARGV"
The array \f(CW@ARGV\fR contains the command-line arguments intended for

one, because \f(CW$ARGV[0]\fR is the first argument, \fInot\fR the program's
command name itself.  See \f(CW$0\fR for the command name.
.IP "\s-1ARGVOUT\s0" 8

The special filehandle that points to the currently open output file
when doing edit-in-place processing with \fB\-i\fR.  Useful when you have

perlrun for the \fB\-i\fR switch.
.IP "@F" 8
.IX Item "@F"
The array \f(CW@F\fR contains the fields of each line read in when autosplit
mode is turned on.  See perlrun for the \fB\-a\fR switch.  This array
is package\-specific, and must be declared or given a full package name
if not in package main when running under \f(CW\*(C`strict 'vars'\*(C'\fR.
.IP "@INC" 8
.IX Item "@INC"
The array \f(CW@INC\fR contains the list of places that the \f(CW\*(C`do EXPR\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR constructs look for their library files.  It
initially consists of the arguments to any \fB\-I\fR command-line
switches, followed by the default Perl library, probably
\&\fI/usr/local/lib/perl\fR, followed by \*(L".\*(R", to represent the current
directory.  (\*(L".\*(R" will not be appended if taint checks are enabled, either by
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR or by \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR.)  If you need to modify this at runtime, you should use
the \f(CW\*(C`use lib\*(C'\fR pragma to get the machine-dependent library properly
loaded also:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use lib '/mypath/libdir/';
\&    use SomeMod;
.Ve
.Sp
You can also insert hooks into the file inclusion system by putting Perl
code directly into \f(CW@INC\fR.  Those hooks may be subroutine references, array
references or blessed objects.  See \*(L"require\*(R" in perlfunc for details.
.IP "@_" 8
.IX Item "@_"
Within a subroutine the array \f(CW@_\fR contains the parameters passed to that
subroutine.  See perlsub.
.IP "%INC" 8
.IX Item "%INC"
The hash \f(CW%INC\fR contains entries for each filename included via the
\&\f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR operators.  The key is the filename
you specified (with module names converted to pathnames), and the
value is the location of the file found.  The \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR
operator uses this hash to determine whether a particular file has
already been included.
.Sp
If the file was loaded via a hook (e.g. a subroutine reference, see
\&\*(L"require\*(R" in perlfunc for a description of these hooks), this hook is
by default inserted into \f(CW%INC\fR in place of a filename.  Note, however,
that the hook may have set the \f(CW%INC\fR entry by itself to provide some more
specific info.

.IP "%SIG" 8
.IX Item "%SIG"
.PD 0
.IP "$SIG{expr}" 8
.IX Item "$SIG{expr}"
.PD
The hash \f(CW%SIG\fR contains signal handlers for signals.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    sub handler {       # 1st argument is signal name
\&        my($sig) = @_;
\&        print "Caught a SIG$sig--shutting down\en";
\&        close(LOG);
\&        exit(0);
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    $SIG{'INT'}  = \e&handler;
\&    $SIG{'QUIT'} = \e&handler;
\&    ...
\&    $SIG{'INT'}  = 'DEFAULT';   # restore default action
\&    $SIG{'QUIT'} = 'IGNORE';    # ignore SIGQUIT
.Ve
.Sp
Using a value of \f(CW'IGNORE'\fR usually has the effect of ignoring the
signal, except for the \f(CW\*(C`CHLD\*(C'\fR signal.  See perlipc for more about
this special case.
.Sp
Here are some other examples:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    $SIG{"PIPE"} = "Plumber";   # assumes main::Plumber (not recommended)
\&    $SIG{"PIPE"} = \e&Plumber;   # just fine; assume current Plumber
\&    $SIG{"PIPE"} = *Plumber;    # somewhat esoteric
\&    $SIG{"PIPE"} = Plumber();   # oops, what did Plumber() return??
.Ve
.Sp
Be sure not to use a bareword as the name of a signal handler,
lest you inadvertently call it. 
.Sp
If your system has the \fIsigaction()\fR function then signal handlers are
installed using it.  This means you get reliable signal handling.
.Sp
The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl 5.8.0 from 
immediate (also known as \*(L"unsafe\*(R") to deferred, also known as 
\&\*(L"safe signals\*(R".  See perlipc for more information.
.Sp
Certain internal hooks can be also set using the \f(CW%SIG\fR hash.  The
routine indicated by \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR is called when a warning message is
about to be printed.  The warning message is passed as the first
argument.  The presence of a _\|_WARN_\|_ hook causes the ordinary printing
of warnings to \s-1STDERR\s0 to be suppressed.  You can use this to save warnings
in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal errors, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] };
\&    eval $proggie;
.Ve
.Sp
The routine indicated by \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR is called when a fatal exception
is about to be thrown.  The error message is passed as the first
argument.  When a _\|_DIE_\|_ hook routine returns, the exception
processing continues as it would have in the absence of the hook,
unless the hook routine itself exits via a \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR, a loop exit, or a \fIdie()\fR.
The \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR handler is explicitly disabled during the call, so that you
can die from a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR handler.  Similarly for \f(CW\*(C`_\|_WARN_\|_\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Due to an implementation glitch, the \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR hook is called
even inside an \fIeval()\fR.  Do not use this to rewrite a pending exception
in \f(CW$@\fR, or as a bizarre substitute for overriding \fICORE::GLOBAL::die()\fR.
This strange action at a distance may be fixed in a future release
so that \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR is only called if your program is about
to exit, as was the original intent.  Any other use is deprecated.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_DIE_\|_\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`_\|_WARN_\|_\*(C'\fR handlers are very special in one respect:
they may be called to report (probable) errors found by the parser.
In such a case the parser may be in inconsistent state, so any
attempt to evaluate Perl code from such a handler will probably
result in a segfault.  This means that warnings or errors that
result from parsing Perl should be used with extreme caution, like
this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    require Carp if defined $^S;
\&    Carp::confess("Something wrong") if defined &Carp::confess;
\&    die "Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give backtrace...
\&         To see backtrace try starting Perl with -MCarp switch";
.Ve
.Sp
Here the first line will load Carp \fIunless\fR it is the parser who
called the handler.  The second line will print backtrace and die if
Carp was available.  The third line will be executed only if Carp was
not available.
.Sp
See \*(L"die\*(R" in perlfunc, \*(L"warn\*(R" in perlfunc, \*(L"eval\*(R" in perlfunc, and
warnings for additional information.
.Sh "Error Indicators"
.IX Subsection "Error Indicators"
The variables \f(CW$@\fR, \f(CW$!\fR, \f(CW$^E\fR, and \f(CW$?\fR contain information
about different types of error conditions that may appear during
execution of a Perl program.  The variables are shown ordered by
the \*(L"distance\*(R" between the subsystem which reported the error and
the Perl process.  They correspond to errors detected by the Perl
interpreter, C library, operating system, or an external program,
respectively.
.PP
To illustrate the differences between these variables, consider the 
following Perl expression, which uses a single-quoted string:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    eval q{
\&        open my $pipe, "/cdrom/install |" or die $!;
\&        my @res = <$pipe>;
\&        close $pipe or die "bad pipe: $?, $!";
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
After execution of this statement all 4 variables may have been set.  
.PP
\&\f(CW$@\fR is set if the string to be \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR\-ed did not compile (this
may happen if \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR were imported with bad prototypes),
or if Perl code executed during evaluation \fIdie()\fRd .  In these cases
the value of $@ is the compile error, or the argument to \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR
(which will interpolate \f(CW$!\fR and \f(CW$?\fR).  (See also Fatal,
though.)
.PP
When the \fIeval()\fR expression above is executed, \fIopen()\fR, \f(CW\*(C`<PIPE>\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR are translated to calls in the C run-time library and
thence to the operating system kernel.  \f(CW$!\fR is set to the C library's
\&\f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR if one of these calls fails. 
.PP
Under a few operating systems, \f(CW$^E\fR may contain a more verbose
error indicator, such as in this case, \*(L"\s-1CDROM\s0 tray not closed.\*(R"
Systems that do not support extended error messages leave \f(CW$^E\fR
the same as \f(CW$!\fR.
.PP
Finally, \f(CW$?\fR may be set to non\-0 value if the external program
\&\fI/cdrom/install\fR fails.  The upper eight bits reflect specific
error conditions encountered by the program (the program's \fIexit()\fR
value).   The lower eight bits reflect mode of failure, like signal
death and core dump information  See \fIwait\fR\|(2) for details.  In
contrast to \f(CW$!\fR and \f(CW$^E\fR, which are set only if error condition
is detected, the variable \f(CW$?\fR is set on each \f(CW\*(C`wait\*(C'\fR or pipe
\&\f(CW\*(C`close\*(C'\fR, overwriting the old value.  This is more like \f(CW$@\fR, which
on every \fIeval()\fR is always set on failure and cleared on success.
.PP
For more details, see the individual descriptions at \f(CW$@\fR, \f(CW$!\fR, \f(CW$^E\fR,

.IX Subsection "Technical Note on the Syntax of Variable Names"
Variable names in Perl can have several formats.  Usually, they
must begin with a letter or underscore, in which case they can be
arbitrarily long (up to an internal limit of 251 characters) and
may contain letters, digits, underscores, or the special sequence
\&\f(CW\*(C`::\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR.  In this case, the part before the last \f(CW\*(C`::\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR is taken to be a \fIpackage qualifier\fR; see perlmod.
.PP
Perl variable names may also be a sequence of digits or a single
punctuation or control character.  These names are all reserved for
special uses by Perl; for example, the all-digits names are used
to hold data captured by backreferences after a regular expression
match.  Perl has a special syntax for the single-control-character
names: It understands \f(CW\*(C`^X\*(C'\fR (caret \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR) to mean the control\-\f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR
character.  For example, the notation \f(CW$^W\fR (dollar\-sign caret
\&\f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR) is the scalar variable whose name is the single character
control\-\f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR.  This is better than typing a literal control\-\f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR
into your program.
.PP
Finally, new in Perl 5.6, Perl variable names may be alphanumeric
strings that begin with control characters (or better yet, a caret).
These variables must be written in the form \f(CW\*(C`${^Foo}\*(C'\fR; the braces
are not optional.  \f(CW\*(C`${^Foo}\*(C'\fR denotes the scalar variable whose
name is a control\-\f(CW\*(C`F\*(C'\fR followed by two \f(CW\*(C`o\*(C'\fR's.  These variables are
reserved for future special uses by Perl, except for the ones that
begin with \f(CW\*(C`^_\*(C'\fR (control\-underscore or caret\-underscore).  No
control-character name that begins with \f(CW\*(C`^_\*(C'\fR will acquire a special
meaning in any future version of Perl; such names may therefore be
used safely in programs.  \f(CW$^_\fR itself, however, \fIis\fR reserved.
.PP
Perl identifiers that begin with digits, control characters, or
punctuation characters are exempt from the effects of the \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR
declaration and are always forced to be in package \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR; they are
also exempt from \f(CW\*(C`strict 'vars'\*(C'\fR errors.  A few other names are also
exempt in these ways:

\&        ENV             STDIN
\&        INC             STDOUT
\&        ARGV            STDERR
\&        ARGVOUT         _
\&        SIG
.Ve
.PP
In particular, the new special \f(CW\*(C`${^_XYZ}\*(C'\fR variables are always taken
to be in package \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR, regardless of any \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR declarations
presently in scope.  
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Due to an unfortunate accident of Perl's implementation, \f(CW\*(C`use
English\*(C'\fR imposes a considerable performance penalty on all regular
expression matches in a program, regardless of whether they occur
in the scope of \f(CW\*(C`use English\*(C'\fR.  For that reason, saying \f(CW\*(C`use
English\*(C'\fR in libraries is strongly discouraged.  See the
Devel::SawAmpersand module documentation from \s-1CPAN\s0
( http://www.cpan.org/modules/by\-module/Devel/ )
for more information.
.PP
Having to even think about the \f(CW$^S\fR variable in your exception
handlers is simply wrong.  \f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR as currently implemented
invites grievous and difficult to track down errors.  Avoid it
and use an \f(CW\*(C`END{}\*(C'\fR or CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.
