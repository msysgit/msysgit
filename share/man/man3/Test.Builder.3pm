.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Test::Simple and Test::More have proven to be popular testing modules,
but they're not always flexible enough.  Test::Builder provides the a
building block upon which to write your own test libraries \fIwhich can
work together\fR.
.Sh "Construction"
.IX Subsection "Construction"
.IP "\fBnew\fR" 4
.IX Item "new"
.Vb 1
\&  my $Test = Test::Builder->new;
.Ve
.Sp
Returns a Test::Builder object representing the current state of the
test.
.Sp
Since you only run one test per program \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR always returns the same
Test::Builder object.  No matter how many times you call \fInew()\fR, you're
getting the same object.  This is called a singleton.  This is done so that
multiple modules share such global information as the test counter and
where test output is going.
.Sp
If you want a completely new Test::Builder object different from the
singleton, use \f(CW\*(C`create\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBcreate\fR" 4
.IX Item "create"
.Vb 1
\&  my $Test = Test::Builder->create;
.Ve
.Sp
Ok, so there can be more than one Test::Builder object and this is how
you get it.  You might use this instead of \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR if you're testing
a Test::Builder based module, but otherwise you probably want \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR: the implementation is not complete.  \f(CW\*(C`level\*(C'\fR, for example, is
still shared amongst \fBall\fR Test::Builder objects, even ones created using
this method.  Also, the method name may change in the future.
.IP "\fBreset\fR" 4
.IX Item "reset"
.Vb 1
\&  $Test->reset;
.Ve
.Sp
Reinitializes the Test::Builder singleton to its original state.
Mostly useful for tests run in persistent environments where the same
test might be run multiple times in the same process.
.Sh "Setting up tests"
.IX Subsection "Setting up tests"
These methods are for setting up tests and declaring how many there
are.  You usually only want to call one of these methods.
.IP "\fBexported_to\fR" 4
.IX Item "exported_to"
.Vb 2
\&  my $pack = $Test->exported_to;
\&  $Test->exported_to($pack);
.Ve
.Sp
Tells Test::Builder what package you exported your functions to.
This is important for getting \s-1TODO\s0 tests right.
.IP "\fBplan\fR" 4
.IX Item "plan"
.Vb 3
\&  $Test->plan('no_plan');
\&  $Test->plan( skip_all => $reason );
\&  $Test->plan( tests => $num_tests );
.Ve
.Sp
A convenient way to set up your tests.  Call this and Test::Builder
will print the appropriate headers and take the appropriate actions.
.Sp
If you call \fIplan()\fR, don't call any of the other methods below.
.IP "\fBexpected_tests\fR" 4
.IX Item "expected_tests"
.Vb 2
\&    my $max = $Test->expected_tests;
\&    $Test->expected_tests($max);
.Ve
.Sp
Gets/sets the # of tests we expect this test to run and prints out
the appropriate headers.
.IP "\fBno_plan\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_plan"
.Vb 1
\&  $Test->no_plan;
.Ve
.Sp
Declares that this test will run an indeterminate # of tests.
.IP "\fBhas_plan\fR" 4
.IX Item "has_plan"
.Vb 1
\&  $plan = $Test->has_plan
.Ve
.Sp
Find out whether a plan has been defined. \f(CW$plan\fR is either \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR (no plan has been set), \f(CW\*(C`no_plan\*(C'\fR (indeterminate # of tests) or an integer (the number of expected tests).
.IP "\fBskip_all\fR" 4
.IX Item "skip_all"
.Vb 2
\&  $Test->skip_all;
\&  $Test->skip_all($reason);
.Ve
.Sp
Skips all the tests, using the given \f(CW$reason\fR.  Exits immediately with 0.
.Sh "Running tests"
.IX Subsection "Running tests"
These actually run the tests, analogous to the functions in
Test::More.
.PP
$name is always optional.
.IP "\fBok\fR" 4
.IX Item "ok"
.Vb 1
\&  $Test->ok($test, $name);
.Ve
.Sp
Your basic test.  Pass if \f(CW$test\fR is true, fail if \f(CW$test\fR is false.  Just
like Test::Simple's \fIok()\fR.
.IP "\fBis_eq\fR" 4
.IX Item "is_eq"
.Vb 1
\&  $Test->is_eq($got, $expected, $name);
.Ve
.Sp
Like Test::More's \fIis()\fR.  Checks if \f(CW$got\fR eq \f(CW$expected\fR.  This is the
string version.
.IP "\fBis_num\fR" 4
.IX Item "is_num"
.Vb 1
\&  $Test->is_num($got, $expected, $name);
.Ve
.Sp
Like Test::More's \fIis()\fR.  Checks if \f(CW$got\fR == \f(CW$expected\fR.  This is the
numeric version.
.IP "\fBisnt_eq\fR" 4
.IX Item "isnt_eq"
.Vb 1
\&  $Test->isnt_eq($got, $dont_expect, $name);
.Ve
.Sp
Like Test::More's \fIisnt()\fR.  Checks if \f(CW$got\fR ne \f(CW$dont_expect\fR.  This is
the string version.
.IP "\fBisnt_num\fR" 4
.IX Item "isnt_num"
.Vb 1
\&  $Test->is_num($got, $dont_expect, $name);
.Ve
.Sp
Like Test::More's \fIisnt()\fR.  Checks if \f(CW$got\fR ne \f(CW$dont_expect\fR.  This is
the numeric version.
.IP "\fBlike\fR" 4
.IX Item "like"
.Vb 2
\&  $Test->like($this, qr/$regex/, $name);
\&  $Test->like($this, '/$regex/', $name);
.Ve
.Sp
Like Test::More's \fIlike()\fR.  Checks if \f(CW$this\fR matches the given \f(CW$regex\fR.
.Sp
You'll want to avoid qr// if you want your tests to work before 5.005.
.IP "\fBunlike\fR" 4
.IX Item "unlike"
.Vb 2
\&  $Test->unlike($this, qr/$regex/, $name);
\&  $Test->unlike($this, '/$regex/', $name);
.Ve
.Sp
Like Test::More's \fIunlike()\fR.  Checks if \f(CW$this\fR \fBdoes not match\fR the
given \f(CW$regex\fR.
.IP "\fBmaybe_regex\fR" 4
.IX Item "maybe_regex"
.Vb 2
\&  $Test->maybe_regex(qr/$regex/);
\&  $Test->maybe_regex('/$regex/');
.Ve
.Sp
Convenience method for building testing functions that take regular
expressions as arguments, but need to work before perl 5.005.
.Sp
Takes a quoted regular expression produced by qr//, or a string
representing a regular expression.
.Sp
Returns a Perl value which may be used instead of the corresponding
regular expression, or undef if it's argument is not recognised.
.Sp
For example, a version of \fIlike()\fR, sans the useful diagnostic messages,
could be written as:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  sub laconic_like {
\&      my ($self, $this, $regex, $name) = @_;
\&      my $usable_regex = $self->maybe_regex($regex);
\&      die "expecting regex, found '$regex'\en"
\&          unless $usable_regex;
\&      $self->ok($this =~ m/$usable_regex/, $name);
\&  }
.Ve
.IP "\fBcmp_ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "cmp_ok"
.Vb 1
\&  $Test->cmp_ok($this, $type, $that, $name);
.Ve
.Sp
Works just like Test::More's \fIcmp_ok()\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $Test->cmp_ok($big_num, '!=', $other_big_num);
.Ve
.IP "\fB\s-1BAIL_OUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "BAIL_OUT"
.Vb 1
\&    $Test->BAIL_OUT($reason);
.Ve
.Sp
Indicates to the Test::Harness that things are going so badly all
testing should terminate.  This includes running any additional test
scripts.
.Sp
It will exit with 255.
.IP "\fBskip\fR" 4
.IX Item "skip"
.Vb 2
\&    $Test->skip;
\&    $Test->skip($why);
.Ve
.Sp
Skips the current test, reporting \f(CW$why\fR.
.IP "\fBtodo_skip\fR" 4
.IX Item "todo_skip"
.Vb 2
\&  $Test->todo_skip;
\&  $Test->todo_skip($why);
.Ve
.Sp
Like \fIskip()\fR, only it will declare the test as failing and \s-1TODO\s0.  Similar
to
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print "not ok $tnum # TODO $why\en";
.Ve
.Sh "Test style"
.IX Subsection "Test style"
.IP "\fBlevel\fR" 4
.IX Item "level"
.Vb 1
\&    $Test->level($how_high);
.Ve
.Sp
How far up the call stack should \f(CW$Test\fR look when reporting where the
test failed.
.Sp
Defaults to 1.
.Sp
Setting \f(CW$Test::Builder::Level\fR overrides.  This is typically useful
localized:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    {
\&        local $Test::Builder::Level = 2;
\&        $Test->ok($test);
\&    }
.Ve
.IP "\fBuse_numbers\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_numbers"
.Vb 1
\&    $Test->use_numbers($on_or_off);
.Ve
.Sp
Whether or not the test should output numbers.  That is, this if true:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  ok 1
\&  ok 2
\&  ok 3
.Ve
.Sp
or this if false
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  ok
\&  ok
\&  ok
.Ve
.Sp
Most useful when you can't depend on the test output order, such as
when threads or forking is involved.
.Sp
Test::Harness will accept either, but avoid mixing the two styles.
.Sp
Defaults to on.
.IP "\fBno_diag\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_diag"
.Vb 1
\&    $Test->no_diag($no_diag);
.Ve
.Sp
If set true no diagnostics will be printed.  This includes calls to
\&\fIdiag()\fR.
.IP "\fBno_ending\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_ending"
.Vb 1
\&    $Test->no_ending($no_ending);
.Ve
.Sp
Normally, Test::Builder does some extra diagnostics when the test
ends.  It also changes the exit code as described below.
.Sp
If this is true, none of that will be done.
.IP "\fBno_header\fR" 4
.IX Item "no_header"
.Vb 1
\&    $Test->no_header($no_header);
.Ve
.Sp
If set to true, no \*(L"1..N\*(R" header will be printed.
.Sh "Output"
.IX Subsection "Output"
Controlling where the test output goes.
.PP
It's ok for your test to change where \s-1STDOUT\s0 and \s-1STDERR\s0 point to,
Test::Builder's default output settings will not be affected.
.IP "\fBdiag\fR" 4
.IX Item "diag"
.Vb 1
\&    $Test->diag(@msgs);
.Ve
.Sp
Prints out the given \f(CW@msgs\fR.  Like \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, arguments are simply
appended together.
.Sp
Normally, it uses the \fIfailure_output()\fR handle, but if this is for a
\&\s-1TODO\s0 test, the \fItodo_output()\fR handle is used.
.Sp
Output will be indented and marked with a # so as not to interfere
with test output.  A newline will be put on the end if there isn't one
already.
.Sp
We encourage using this rather than calling print directly.
.Sp
Returns false.  Why?  Because \fIdiag()\fR is often used in conjunction with
a failing test (\f(CW\*(C`ok() || diag()\*(C'\fR) it \*(L"passes through\*(R" the failure.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    return ok(...) || diag(...);
.Ve
.IP "\fB_print_diag\fR" 4
.IX Item "_print_diag"
.Vb 1
\&    $Test->_print_diag(@msg);
.Ve
.Sp
Like _print, but prints to the current diagnostic filehandle.
.IP "\fBoutput\fR" 4
.IX Item "output"
.Vb 2
\&    $Test->output($fh);
\&    $Test->output($file);
.Ve
.Sp
Where normal \*(L"ok/not ok\*(R" test output should go.
.Sp
Defaults to \s-1STDOUT\s0.
.IP "\fBfailure_output\fR" 4
.IX Item "failure_output"
.Vb 2
\&    $Test->failure_output($fh);
\&    $Test->failure_output($file);
.Ve
.Sp
Where diagnostic output on test failures and \fIdiag()\fR should go.
.Sp
Defaults to \s-1STDERR\s0.
.IP "\fBtodo_output\fR" 4
.IX Item "todo_output"
.Vb 2
\&    $Test->todo_output($fh);
\&    $Test->todo_output($file);
.Ve
.Sp
Where diagnostics about todo test failures and \fIdiag()\fR should go.
.Sp
Defaults to \s-1STDOUT\s0.
.Sh "Test Status and Info"
.IX Subsection "Test Status and Info"
.IP "\fBcurrent_test\fR" 4
.IX Item "current_test"
.Vb 2
\&    my $curr_test = $Test->current_test;
\&    $Test->current_test($num);
.Ve
.Sp
Gets/sets the current test number we're on.  You usually shouldn't
have to set this.
.Sp
If set forward, the details of the missing tests are filled in as 'unknown'.
if set backward, the details of the intervening tests are deleted.  You
can erase history if you really want to.
.IP "\fBsummary\fR" 4
.IX Item "summary"
.Vb 1
\&    my @tests = $Test->summary;
.Ve
.Sp
A simple summary of the tests so far.  True for pass, false for fail.
This is a logical pass/fail, so todos are passes.
.Sp
Of course, test #1 is \f(CW$tests\fR[0], etc...
.IP "\fBdetails\fR" 4
.IX Item "details"
.Vb 1
\&    my @tests = $Test->details;
.Ve
.Sp
Like \fIsummary()\fR, but with a lot more detail.
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    $tests[$test_num - 1] = 
\&            { 'ok'       => is the test considered a pass?
\&              actual_ok  => did it literally say 'ok'?
\&              name       => name of the test (if any)
\&              type       => type of test (if any, see below).
\&              reason     => reason for the above (if any)
\&            };
.Ve
.Sp
\&'ok' is true if Test::Harness will consider the test to be a pass.
.Sp
\&'actual_ok' is a reflection of whether or not the test literally
printed 'ok' or 'not ok'.  This is for examining the result of 'todo'
tests.  
.Sp
\&'name' is the name of the test.
.Sp
\&'type' indicates if it was a special test.  Normal tests have a type
of ''.  Type can be one of the following:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    skip        see skip()
\&    todo        see todo()
\&    todo_skip   see todo_skip()
\&    unknown     see below
.Ve
.Sp
Sometimes the Test::Builder test counter is incremented without it
printing any test output, for example, when \fIcurrent_test()\fR is changed.
In these cases, Test::Builder doesn't know the result of the test, so
it's type is 'unkown'.  These details for these tests are filled in.
They are considered ok, but the name and actual_ok is left undef.
.Sp
For example \*(L"not ok 23 \- hole count # \s-1TODO\s0 insufficient donuts\*(R" would
result in this structure:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    $tests[22] =    # 23 - 1, since arrays start from 0.
\&      { ok        => 1,   # logically, the test passed since it's todo
\&        actual_ok => 0,   # in absolute terms, it failed
\&        name      => 'hole count',
\&        type      => 'todo',
\&        reason    => 'insufficient donuts'
\&      };
.Ve
.IP "\fBtodo\fR" 4
.IX Item "todo"
.Vb 2
\&    my $todo_reason = $Test->todo;
\&    my $todo_reason = $Test->todo($pack);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fItodo()\fR looks for a \f(CW$TODO\fR variable in your tests.  If set, all tests
will be considered 'todo' (see Test::More and Test::Harness for
details).  Returns the reason (ie. the value of \f(CW$TODO\fR) if running as
todo tests, false otherwise.
.Sp
\&\fItodo()\fR is about finding the right package to look for \f(CW$TODO\fR in.  It
uses the \fIexported_to()\fR package to find it.  If that's not set, it's
pretty good at guessing the right package to look at based on \f(CW$Level\fR.
.Sp
Sometimes there is some confusion about where \fItodo()\fR should be looking
for the \f(CW$TODO\fR variable.  If you want to be sure, tell it explicitly
what \f(CW$pack\fR to use.
.IP "\fBcaller\fR" 4
.IX Item "caller"
.Vb 3
\&    my $package = $Test->caller;
\&    my($pack, $file, $line) = $Test->caller;
\&    my($pack, $file, $line) = $Test->caller($height);
.Ve
.Sp
Like the normal \fIcaller()\fR, except it reports according to your \fIlevel()\fR.

If all your tests passed, Test::Builder will exit with zero (which is
normal).  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed.  If
you run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras)
will be considered failures.  If no tests were ever run Test::Builder
will throw a warning and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after
having successfully completed all its tests, it will still be
considered a failure and will exit with 255.
.PP
So the exit codes are...
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    0                   all tests successful
\&    255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
\&    any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)
.Ve
.PP
If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.
.SH "THREADS"
.IX Header "THREADS"
In perl 5.8.0 and later, Test::Builder is thread\-safe.  The test
number is shared amongst all threads.  This means if one thread sets
the test number using \fIcurrent_test()\fR they will all be effected.
.PP
Test::Builder is only thread-aware if threads.pm is loaded \fIbefore\fR
Test::Builder.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

\&\s-1CPAN\s0 can provide the best examples.  Test::Simple, Test::More,
Test::Exception and Test::Differences all use Test::Builder.
