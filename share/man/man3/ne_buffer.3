.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The \fBne_buffer\fR type represents an expandable memory buffer for holding NUL\-terminated strings\&. The data field points to the beginnning of the string, the length of which is given by the used field\&. The current size of memory allocated is given by the length field\&. It is not recommended that the fields of a buffer are manipulated directly\&. The data pointer may change when the buffer is modified\&.

.PP
A buffer is created using \fBne_buffer_create\fR(3) or \fBne_buffer_ncreate\fR(3), and destroyed using \fBne_buffer_destroy\fR(3) or \fBne_buffer_finish\fR(3)\&. The functions \fBne_buffer_append\fR(3), \fBne_buffer_zappend\fR(3) and \fBne_buffer_concat\fR(3) are used to append data to a buffer\&.

.PP
If the string referenced by the data pointer is modified directly (rather than using one of the functions listed above), \fBne_buffer_altered\fR must be called\&.
