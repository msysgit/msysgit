Subject: [PATCH] Perl readline creates empty sys$command files if no STDIN is
 connected

This was originally reported to TortoiseGit:
http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/issues/detail?id=1011

This patch was also reported to MinGW
(http://sourceforge.net/p/mingw/patches/506/) and upstream perl
(https://rt.perl.org//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=115900) where it was
finally accepted and applied (to version 5.18).
