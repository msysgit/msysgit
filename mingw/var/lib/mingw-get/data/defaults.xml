    Master configuration profile for mingw-get.

    This file is user modifiable, to accommodate local customisation
    of mingw-get's behaviour.  To avoid overwriting the user's local
    customisations, when upgrading the mingw-get installation, this
    file is distributed with the alternative name "defaults.xml"; a
    locally customised version should always be renamed, so that it
    may be identified as the preferentially loaded "profile.xml".

  <repository uri="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/%F.xml.lzma?download">
    <!--
      The "repository" specification identifies the URI where package
      list catalogues may be downloaded; each catalogue download URI is
      identified by substituting the catalogue name for the "%F" field
      in the uri specification.

      You may specify a particular collection of package lists to load
      here, (selecting from the available catalogue-name.xml.lzma files
      hosted on the repository server).  If you do this, then ONLY those
      package lists which you explicitly specify will be loaded.  If you
      specify no package list here, then the repository's standard list
      of packages, as identified in the master "package-list.xml.lzma"
      file will be automatically selected; this is the recommended
      configuration choice.

      Note however, that if the repository offers optional package list
      selections, in addition to the the master list, and you wish any of
      these to be loaded, then you MUST explicitly specify them here.  If
      you exercise this option, then the automatic loading of the master
      list will be inhibited, UNLESS you also explicitly include it in
      your selection, by adding the explicit reference:-

	<package-list catalogue="package-list" />

      Additional package lists, which you wish to specify, are then
      identified by the addition of as many further references of the
      form:-

	<package-list catalogue="catalogue-name" />

      as may be required; (note that the "catalogue" attribute name
      MUST be specified thus, with the GB English spelling).

  <system-map id="default">
    <!--
      The system map specifies the installation paths for each managed
      subsystem.  Multiple system maps are supported, provided each is
      given a unique "id" attribute; each specifies an "installation",
      comprising a collection of subsystems, each of which in turn is
      associated with a specific "sysroot path".
      
      Each individual "sysroot path" defines one installation of one
      specific subsystem; parallel installations may be supported by
      assigning distinct paths to two or more sysroot specifications
      for the same subsystem; each such sysroot specification must
      then be assigned to a distinct system-map.

      Any single sysroot definition may be shared by any number of
      system-maps, simply by duplicating that definition within each;
      however, each system-map may contain only one sysroot definition
      for each individual subsystem.

      Only one system map may be active at any time.  Unless otherwise
      specified by user selection, the first encountered is accepted as
      default, irrespective of its actual "id" attribute value.
