1 Introduction
**************

msmtp is an SMTP client.

   In its default mode of operation, it reads a mail from standard
input and sends it to a predefined SMTP server that takes care of
proper delivery. Command line options and exit codes are compatible to
sendmail.

   Supported SMTP features include:
   * Authentication methods PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5 and EXTERNAL (and
     GSSAPI, DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM when compiled with GNU SASL support)

   * TLS encrypted connections with the OpenSSL or GnuTLS libraries
     (including server certificate verification and the possibility to
     send a client certificate)

   * Support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)

   * DSN (Delivery Status Notification) support

   * PIPELINING support for increased transmission speed

   * RMQS (Remote Message Queue Starting) support (ETRN keyword)

   The best way to start is probably to have a look at the Examples
section.  *Note Examples::.

   In addition to sendmail mode, there are two other modes of operation:
   * Server information mode. In this mode, msmtp prints as much
     information as it can get about a given SMTP server (supported
     features, maximum mail size, ...).

   * Remote Message Queue Starting mode. In this mode, msmtp sends a
     Remote Message Queue Starting request for a host, domain, or queue
     to a given SMTP server.

   Normally, a system wide configuration file and/or a user
configuration file contain information about which SMTP server to use
and how to use it, but almost all settings can also be configured on
the command line.

   The information about SMTP servers is organized in accounts. Each
account describes one SMTP server: host name, authentication settings,
TLS settings, and so on.  Each configuration file can define multiple
accounts.

2 Configuration files
*********************

msmtp supports a system wide configuration file and a user
configuration file.  Both are optional and need not exist.

   If it exists and is readable, a system wide configuration file
`SYSCONFDIR/msmtprc' will be loaded, where `SYSCONFDIR' depends on your
platform. The default is `/usr/local/etc'.  Use `--version' to find out
which directory your version uses.

   If it exists and is readable, a user configuration file will be
loaded (`~/.msmtprc' by default). Accounts defined in the user
configuration file override accounts from the system configuration
file.  The user configuration file must have no more permissions than
user read/write.  Configuration data from either file can be changed by
command line options.

   A configuration file is a simple text file. Empty lines and comment
lines (whose first non-blank character is '#') are ignored. Every other
line must contain a command and may contain an argument to that command.
The argument may be enclosed in double quotes (").

   If the first character of a filename is the tilde (~), this tilde
will be replaced by `HOME'.  If a command accepts the argument `on', it
also accepts an empty argument and treats that as if it was `on'.

   Commands form groups. Each group starts with the `account' command
and defines the settings for one SMTP server.

   *Note Examples::.

2.1 General commands
====================

`defaults'
     Set defaults. The following configuration commands will set
     default values for all following account definitions in the
     current configuration file.

`account NAME [: ACCOUNT[,...]]'
     Start a new account definition with the given name. The current
     default values are filled in (see *note defaults::).
     If a colon and a list of previously defined accounts is given
     after the account name, the new account, with the filled in
     default values, will inherit all settings from the accounts in the
     list.

`host HOSTNAME'
     The SMTP server to send the mail to.  The argument may be a host
     name or a network address.  Every account definition must contain
     this command.

`port NUMBER'
     The port that the SMTP server listens on.  The default port will
     be acquired from your operating system's service database: for
     SMTP, the service is "smtp" (default port 25), unless TLS without
     STARTTLS is used, in which case it is "ssmtp" (465). For LMTP, it
     is "lmtp".

`timeout (off|SECONDS)'
     Set or unset a network timeout, in seconds. The argument `off'
     means that no timeout will be set, which means that the operating
     system default will be used.  For compatibility with older
     versions, `connect_timeout' is accepted as an alias for this
     command.

`protocol (smtp|lmtp)'
     Set the protocol to use. Currently only SMTP and LMTP are
     supported. SMTP is the default. See *note port:: for default ports.

`domain ARGUMENT'
     This command sets the argument of the SMTP EHLO (or LMTP LHLO)
     command. The default is `localhost', which is stupid but should
     always work.  Possible choices are the domain part of your mail
     address (`provider.example' for `joe@provider.example') or the
     fully qualified domain name of your host (if available).

2.2 Authentication commands
===========================

*Note Authentication::.

`auth [(on|off|METHOD)]'
     This command enables or disables SMTP authentication and
     optionally chooses an authentication method to use. It should not
     be necessary to choose a method; with the argument `on', msmtp
     will choose the best one available.  Accepted methods are `plain',
     `cram-md5', `digest-md5', `gssapi', `external', `login', and
     `ntlm'.  *Note Authentication::.
`user [USERNAME]'
     Set your user name for SMTP authentication. An empty argument
     unsets the user name.  Authentication must be activated with the
     `auth' command.

`password [SECRET]'
     Set your password for SMTP authentication. An empty argument
     unsets the password.  Authentication must be activated with the
     `auth' command.  If no password is set but one is needed during
     authentication, msmtp will try to find it in `~/.netrc'. If that
     fails, it will try to find it in `SYSCONFDIR/netrc' (use
     `--version' to find out what `SYSCONFDIR' is on your platform). If
     that fails, it will try to get it from a system specific keychain
     (if available). If that fails but a controlling terminal is
     available, msmtp will prompt you for it.  *Note Authentication::.

`ntlmdomain [NTLMDOMAIN]'
     Set a domain for the `ntlm' authentication method. The default is
     to use no domain (equivalent to an empty argument), but some
     servers seem to require one, even if it is an arbitrary string.

2.3 TLS commands
================

*Note Transport Layer Security::.

`tls [(on|off)]'
     This command enables or disables TLS/SSL encrypted connections to
     the SMTP server. Not every server supports TLS, and a few that
     support it require the `tls_starttls off' command.
     To use TLS/SSL, it is required to either use the `tls_trust_file'
     command (highly recommended) or to disable `tls_certcheck'.  *Note
     Transport Layer Security::.

`tls_trust_file [FILE]'
     This command activates strict server certificate verification.
     The given file must contain one or more certificates of trusted
     Certification Authorities (CAs) in PEM format.
     On Debian based systems, you can install the `ca-certificates'
     package and use the file `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'.
     An empty argument disables this feature.

`tls_crl_file [FILE]'
     This command sets or unsets a certificate revocation list (CRL)
     file for TLS, to be used during strict server certificate
     verification as enabled by the *note tls_trust_file:: command.
     This allows the verification procedure to detect revoked
     certificates.  *Note Transport Layer Security::.

`tls_key_file [FILE]'
     This command (together with the `tls_cert_file') command enables
     msmtp to send a client certificate to the SMTP server if requested.
     The file must contain the private key of a certificate in PEM
     format.  An empty argument disables this feature.  *Note Transport
     Layer Security::.

`tls_cert_file [FILE]'
     This command (together with the `tls_key_file' command) enables
     msmtp to send a client certificate to the SMTP server if requested.
     The file must contain a certificate in PEM format.  An empty
     argument disables this feature.  *Note Transport Layer Security::.

`tls_certcheck [(on|off)]'
     This command enables or disables checks for the server certificate.
     WARNING: When the checks are disabled, TLS/SSL sessions will be
     vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks! *Note Transport Layer
     Security::.
     For compatibility with older versions, `tls_nocertcheck' is
     accepted as an alias for `tls_certcheck off'.

`tls_starttls [(on|off)]'
     This command enables or disables the use of the STARTTLS SMTP
     command to start TLS encryption. It is enabled by default.  *Note
     Transport Layer Security::.  For compatibility with older
     versions, `tls_nostarttls' is accepted as an alias for
     `tls_starttls off'.

`tls_force_sslv3 [(on|off)]'
     Force TLS/SSL version SSLv3. This might be needed to use SSL with
     some old and broken servers. Do not use this unless you have to.
     *Note Transport Layer Security::.

`tls_min_dh_prime_bits [BITS]'
     Set or unset the minimum number of Diffie-Hellman (DH) prime bits
     that msmtp will accept for TLS sessions. The default is set by the
     TLS library and can be selected by using an empty argument to this
     command. Only lower the default (for example to 512 bits) if there
     is no other way to make TLS work with the remote server.  *Note
     Transport Layer Security::.

`tls_priorities [PRIORITIES]'
     Set the priorities for TLS sessions. The default is set by the TLS
     library and can be selected by using an empty argument to this
     command.  Currently this command only works with sufficiently
     recent GnuTLS releases. See the GnuTLS documentation of the
     `gnutls_priority_init' function for a description of the
     PRIORITIES string.  *Note Transport Layer Security::.

2.4 Commands specific to sendmail mode
======================================

*Note Sendmail mode::.

`auto_from [(on|off)]'
     Enable or disable automatic envelope-from addresses. The default is
     `off'.
     When enabled, an envelope-from address of the form user@domain
     will be generated.  The local part will be set to `USER' or, if
     that fails, to `LOGNAME' or, if that fails, to the login name of
     the current user.  The domain part can be set with the
     `maildomain' command (see *note maildomain::).  If the maildomain
     is empty, the envelope-from address will only consist of the user
     name and not have a domain part.
     When disabled, the envelope-from address must be set explicitly
     with the `from' command (see *note from::).
     *Note Envelope-from address::.

`from [ADDRESS]'
     Set the envelope-from address. This address will only be used when
     `auto_from' is disabled.  *Note Envelope-from address::.

`maildomain [DOMAIN]'
     Set a domain part for the generation of an envelope-from address.
     This is only used when `auto_from' is enabled. The domain may be
     empty.  *Note Envelope-from address::.

`dsn_notify (off|CONDITION)'
     This command sets the condition(s) under which the mail system
     should send DSN (Delivery Status Notification) messages. The
     argument off disables explicit DSN requests, which means the mail
     system decides when to send DSN messages. This is the default.
     The CONDITION must be `never', to never request notification, or a
     comma separated list (no spaces!) of one or more of the following:
     `failure', to request notification on transmission failure,
     `delay', to be notified of message delays, `success', to be
     notified of successful transmission.  The SMTP server must support
     the DSN extension.  *Note Delivery Status Notifications::.

`dsn_return (off|AMOUNT)'
     This command controls how much of a mail should be returned in DSN
     (Delivery Status Notification) messages. The argument off disables
     explicit DSN requests, which means the mail system decides how
     much of a mail it returns in DSN messages. This is the default.
     The AMOUNT must be `headers', to just return the message headers,
     or `full', to return the full mail.  The SMTP server must support
     the DSN extension.  *Note Delivery Status Notifications::.

`keepbcc [(on|off)]'
     This command controls whether to remove or keep the Bcc header
     when sending a mail. The default is to remove it. *Note Bcc
     header::.

`logfile [FILE]'
     This command enables or disables logging to the specified file. An
     empty argument disables this feature. The file name `-' directs
     the log information to standard output.  *Note Logging::.

`syslog [(on|off|FACILITY)]'
     This command enables or disables syslog logging. The facility can
     be one of `LOG_USER', `LOG_MAIL', `LOG_LOCAL0', ..., `LOG_LOCAL7'.
     The default facility is `LOG_USER'. Syslog logging is disabled by
     default.  *Note Logging::.

3 Invocation
************

3.1 Synopsis
============

   * Sendmail mode (default):
     `msmtp [OPTION...] [--] RECIPIENT...'
     `msmtp [OPTION...] -t [--] [RECIPIENT...]'

   * Server information mode:
     `msmtp [OPTION...] --serverinfo'

   * Remote Message Queue Starting mode:
     `msmtp [OPTION...]  --rmqs=(HOST|@DOMAIN|#QUEUE)'

3.2 Options
===========

Options override configuration file settings. They are compatible with
sendmail where appropriate.

3.2.1 General options
---------------------

`--version'
     Print version information. This includes information about the
     library used for TLS/SSL support (if any), the library used for
     authentication, the authentication mechanisms supported by this
     library, and the default locations of the system and user
     configuration files.

`--help'
     Print help.

`-P'
`--pretend'
     Print the configuration settings that would be used, but do not
     take further action.  An asterisk ('*') will be printed instead of
     the password.

`-d'
`--debug'
     Print lots of debugging information, including the whole
     conversation with the SMTP server. Be careful with this option:
     the (potentially dangerous) output will not be sanitized, and your
     password may get printed in an easily decodable format!

3.2.2 Changing the mode of operation
------------------------------------

`-S'
`--serverinfo'
     Print information about the SMTP server and exit. This includes
     information about supported features (mail size limit,
     authentication, TLS, DSN, ...)  and about the TLS certificate (if
     TLS is active).  *Note Server information mode::.

`--rmqs=(HOST|@DOMAIN|#QUEUE)'
     Send a Remote Message Queue Starting request for the given host,
     domain, or queue to the SMTP server and exit.  *Note Remote
     Message Queue Starting mode::.

3.2.3 Configuration options
---------------------------

Most options in this category correspond to a configuration file
command.  Please refer to *note Configuration files:: for detailed
information.
`-C FILENAME'
`--file=FILENAME'
     Use the given file instead of `~/.msmtprc' as the user
     configuration file.

`-a ACCOUNT'
`--account=ACCOUNT'
     Use the given account instead of the account named `default'. This
     option cannot be used together with the `--host' option.  *Note
     Choosing an account::.

`--host=HOSTNAME'
     Use this SMTP server with settings from the command line; do not
     use any configuration file data. This option cannot be used
     together with the `--account' option. It disables loading of
     configuration files.  *Note Choosing an account::.

`--port=NUMBER'
     Set the port number to connect to. *Note port::.

`--timeout=(off|SECONDS)'
     Set a network timeout. *Note timeout::. For compatibility with
     older versions, `--connect-timeout' is accepted as an alias for
     this option.

`--protocol=(smtp|lmtp)'
     Set the protocol. *Note protocol::.

`--domain=[ARGUMENT]'
     Set the argument of the SMTP EHLO (or LMTP LHLO) command. *Note

     Set or unset a certificate revocation list (CRL) file for TLS.
     *Note tls_crl_file::.

`--tls-key-file=[FILE]'
     Set or unset a key file for TLS encryption. *Note tls_key_file::.

`--tls-cert-file=[FILE]'
     Set or unset a cert file for TLS encryption. *Note tls_cert_file::.

`--tls-certcheck[=(on|off)]'
     Enable or disable server certificate checks for TLS encryption.
     *Note tls_certcheck::.

`--tls-force-sslv3[=(on|off)]'
     Force TLS/SSL version SSLv3. *Note tls_force_sslv3::.

`--tls-min-dh-prime-bits=[BITS]'
     Set or unset minimum bit size of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) prime.
     *Note tls_min_dh_prime_bits::.

`--tls-priorities=[PRIORITIES]'
     Set or unset TLS priorities. *Note tls_priorities::.

3.2.4 Options specific to sendmail mode
---------------------------------------

`--auto-from[=(on|off)]'
     Enable or disable automatic envelope-from addresses. The default
     is off.  *Note auto_from::.

`-f ADDRESS'
`--from=ADDRESS'
     Set the envelope-from address. It is only used when `auto_from' is
     off.  *Note from::.
     If no account was chosen yet (with `--account' or `--host'), this
     option will choose the first account that has the given
     envelope-from address (set with the `from' command). If no such
     account is found, "default" is used. *Note Choosing an account::.

`--maildomain=[DOMAIN]'
     Set the domain part for generated envelope-from addresses. It is
     only used when `auto_from' is on. *Note maildomain::.

`-N (off|CONDITION)'
`--dsn-notify=(off|CONDITION)'
     Set or unset DSN notification conditions. *Note dsn_notify::.

`-R (off|AMOUNT)'
`--dsn-return=(off|AMOUNT)'
     Set or unset the DSN notification amount. *Note dsn_return::.
     Note that `hdrs' is accepted as an alias for `headers' to be
     compatible with sendmail.

`--keepbcc[=(on|off)]'
     Enable or disable the preservation of the Bcc header. *Note
     keepbcc::.

`-X [FILE]'
`--logfile=[FILE]'
     Set or unset the log file. *Note logfile::.

`--syslog[=(on|off|FACILITY)]'
     Enable or disable syslog logging. *Note syslog::.

`-t'
`--read-recipients'
     Send the mail to the recipients given in the To, Cc, and Bcc
     headers of the mail in addition to the recipients given on the
     command line.
     If any Resent- headers are present, then the addresses from any
     Resent-To, Resent-Cc, and Resent-Bcc headers in the first block of
     Resent- headers are used instead.

`--read-recipients'
     Read the envelope from address from the From header of the mail.

`--'
     This marks the end of options. All following arguments will be
     treated as recipient addresses, even if they start with a '-'.

   The following options are accepted but ignored for sendmail
compatibility: `-BTYPE', `-bm', `-FNAME', `-G', `-hN', `-i', `-L TAG',
`-m', `-n', `-O option=VALUE', `-ox VALUE', `-v'

3.3 Choosing an account
=======================

There are three ways to choose the account to use.  It depends on the
circumstances which method is the best.

  1. `--account=ACCOUNT'
     Use the given account. Command line settings override
     configuration file settings.

  2. `--host=HOSTNAME'
     Use only the settings from the command line; do not use any
     configuration file data.

  3. `--from=ADDRESS' or `--read-envelope-from'
     Choose the first account from the system or user configuration
     file that has a matching envelope-from address as specified by a
     `from' command. This works only when neither `--account' nor
     `--host' is used.
        If none of the above options is used (or if no account has a
matching `from' command), then the account "default" is used.

3.4 Exit code
=============

The standard exit codes from `sysexits.h' are used.

3.5 Files
=========

``SYSCONFDIR/msmtprc''
     The system configuration file. Use the `--version' option to find
     out what `SYSCONFDIR' is on your platform.

``~/.msmtprc''
     The default user configuration file.

``~/.netrc' and `SYSCONFDIR/netrc''
     The `netrc' file contains login information. If a password is not
     found in the configuration file, msmtp will search it in
     `~/.netrc' and `SYSCONFDIR' before prompting the user for it. The
     syntax of `netrc' files is described in the `netrc(5)' or `ftp(1)'
     manual page.

3.6 Environment
===============

``USER', `LOGNAME''
     These variables override the user's login name when constructing an
     envelope-from address. `LOGNAME' is only used if `USER' is unset.

``TMPDIR''
     Directory to create temporary files in. If this is unset, a system
     specific default directory is used.
     A temporary file is only created when the `-t'/`--read-recipients'
     or `--read-envelope-from' option is used. The file is then used to
     buffer the headers of the mail (but not the body, so the file
     won't get very large).

``EMAIL', `SMTPSERVER''
     These environment variables are used only if neither `--host' nor
     `--account' is used and there is no default account defined in the
     configuration files. In this case, the host name is taken from
     `SMTPSERVER', and the envelope from address is taken from `EMAIL',
     unless overridden by `--from' or `--read-envelope-from'. Currently
     `SMTPSERVER' must contain a plain host name (no URL), and `EMAIL'
     must contain a plain address (no names or additional information).

4 Transport Layer Security
**************************

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a new name for Secure Socket Layer
(SSL).  The TLS 1.0 protocol is an updated version of the SSL 3.0
protocol. TLS and SSL mean the same thing.

   Quoting from RFC2246, the TLS 1.0 protocol specification:
"The TLS protocol provides communications privacy over the Internet.
The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way
that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message
forgery."

   SMTP servers can use TLS in one of two modes:
   * Immediately. This is SMTP tunneled through TLS, aka SSMTP. The
     default port for this mode is 465 (ssmtp).

   * Via the STARTTLS SMTP command.  The SMTP session begins normally.
     The client sends the STARTTLS command when it wishes to begin TLS
     encryption. The default port for this mode is the default SMTP
     port: 25 (smtp).
   msmtp can switch between these modes with the `tls_starttls' command
(see *note tls_starttls::) command or the `--tls-starttls' option (see
*note --tls-starttls::).

   When TLS is started, the server sends a certificate to identify
itself. This certificate contains information about the certificate
owner, the certificate issuer, and the activation and expiration times
of the certificate.  This information can be displayed in server
information mode.  *Note Server information mode::.

   To use TLS, it is required to either enable full server certificate
verification using the `tls_trust_file' command or `--tls-trust-file'
option, or to disable all certificate checks using `tls_certcheck off'
or `--tls-certcheck=off'. WARNING: When certificate checks are disabled,
TLS/SSL sessions are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks!  See
*note tls_trust_file::, *note --tls-trust-file::, *note tls_certcheck::,
*note --tls-certcheck::.

   If your system has a file that collects all system-wide trusted CA
certificates, it is easiest to just use this in the `defaults' section
of your configuration file. On Debian-based systems, for example, the
adequate command would be `tls_trust_file
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'.

   But you can also find out manually which CA certificate you need to
trust. The following example works as of 2007-04-18.

   For the Gmail SMTP server, you first issue the following command:
     $ msmtp --serverinfo --host=smtp.gmail.com --tls=on --port=587 \
       --tls-certcheck=off
   The option `--port=587' is specific to Gmail and should not be used
with other servers. The option `--tls-certcheck=off' allows msmtp to
accept any certificate, so that it can print some information about it.

   According to the output of this command, the common name of the
server certificate issuer is "Thawte Premium Server CA". This means
that you have to trust the Thawte CA to use full TLS security. You can
download the Thawte CA certificate bundle from
`http://thawte.com/roots'. You get a ZIP file with different
certificates. The one you need for the `tls_trust_file' command is
`Thawte Server Roots/ThawtePremiumServerCA_b64.txt'.

   The following command should now succeed:
     $ msmtp --serverinfo --host=smtp.gmail.com --tls=on --port=587 \
       --tls-trust-file="Thawte Server Roots/ThawtePremiumServerCA_b64.txt"

   If the server requests it, the client can send a certificate, too.
This allows the server to verify the identity of the client. See the
EXTERNAL mechanism in *note Authentication::. The
`tls_key_file'/`tls_cert_file' commands or the
`--tls-key-file'/`--tls-cert-file' options can be used to set a client
certificate. See *note tls_key_file::/*note --tls-key-file::, *note
tls_cert_file::/*note --tls-cert-file::.  Note that GnuTLS will only
send a client certificate if it matches one of the CAs advertised by
the server. If you set a client certificate but it is not send to the
server, it probably was not issued by any CA that the server trusts.

   If you need to fine tune TLS parameters or have problems connecting
to your server, have a look at the *note tls_force_sslv3::, *note
tls_min_dh_prime_bits::, and *note tls_priorities:: commands.

5 Authentication
****************

Many SMTP servers require a client to authenticate itself before it is
allowed to send mail.

   Multiple authentication methods exist. Most SMTP servers support
only some of them.  Some methods send authentication data in plain text
(or nearly plain text) to the server. These methods should only be used
when TLS is active to prevent others from stealing the password. *Note
Transport Layer Security::.

   By default, msmtp chooses a method automatically, and it will never
choose one that puts the authentication data at risk. See below for
details.

   msmtp supports the following authentication methods:
   * `PLAIN'
     This authentication method needs a user name and a password.  Both
     are send in BASE64 encoding, which can be easily decoded to plain
     text.

   * `CRAM-MD5'
     This authentication method needs a user name and a password.  The
     authentication data is not sent in plain text, which means this
     method can safely be used without TLS.

   * `DIGEST-MD5'
     This authentication method needs a user name and a password.  The
     authentication data is not sent in plain text, which means this
     method can safely be used without TLS.

   * `GSSAPI'
     This authentication method needs a user name. The Kerberos
     framework takes care of secure authentication, therefore this
     method can safely be used without TLS.

   * `EXTERNAL'
     This is a special authentication method: The actual authentication
     happens outside of the SMTP protocol, typically by sending a TLS
     client certificate (see *note Transport Layer Security::).
     The EXTERNAL method merely confirms that this authentication
     succeeded for the given user (or, if no user name is given,
     confirms that authentication succeeded). Thus it may not be
     necessary for authentication to use this method, and if the server
     does not support the EXTERNAL method, this does not mean that it
     does not support authentication with TLS client certificates.
     This authentication method is not chosen automatically; you have
     to request it manually.
     Note: Sendmail 8.12.11 advertises the EXTERNAL mechanism only
     after a TLS client certificate has been send. It seems to ignore
     the optional user name.  Does anyone know more about this?

   * `LOGIN'
     This is a non-standard authentication method similar to (but worse
     than) PLAIN.  It needs a user name and a password, both of which
     are send in BASE64 encoding, which can be easily decoded to plain
     text.

   * `NTLM'
     This is an obscure non-standard authentication method. It needs a
     user name and a password and in some cases a special domain
     parameter (see *note ntlmdomain::).  The authentication data is
     not send in plain text, but since NTLM is not an open standard, it
     should be considered broken and insecure.

   It depends on the underlying authentication library and its version
whether a particular method is supported or not. Use the `--version' to
find out which methods are supported by your version of msmtp.

   Authentication data can be set with the `user' and `password'
commands or with the `--user' option. See *note user::, *note
password::, *note --user::.  If no password is set but one is needed
during authentication, msmtp will try to find it in `~/.netrc'. If that
fails, it will try to find it in `SYSCONFDIR/netrc' (use `--version' to
find out what `SYSCONFDIR' is on your platform). If that fails, it will
try to get it from a system specific keychain (if available). If that
fails but a controlling terminal is available, msmtp will prompt you
for it.

   Currently supported keychains are the GNOME keychain and the Mac OS
X keychain.  *Note Using the Mac OS X Keychain::.

   The authentication method can be chosen with the `auth' command or
`--auth' option, but it is usually sufficient to just use the `on'
argument to let msmtp choose the method itself. See *note auth::, *note
--auth::.

   If msmtp chooses the method itself, it will never choose an insecure
method.  If TLS is active, all methods are considered secure in this
context, because the connection to the server is protected by TLS. If
TLS is not active, only the CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and GSSAPI methods
are considered secure in this context, because all the others methods
put the authentication data at risk.

   If you really want to risk your authentication data, you have to
force msmtp to do that by manually setting the authentication method
while TLS is off.

5.1 Using the Mac OS X Keychain
===============================

A Mac OS X user can store a password in a keychain item using the
Keychain Access GUI application. The `account name' is simply the value
of the msmtp `user' argument. However, the `keychain item name' is
`smtp://<hostname>' where `<hostname>' matches the msmtp `host'
argument. Using `smtp://' is needed so that the item is created of kind
`internet password'.  For example, selecting `File->Get Info' on a
keychain item that corresponds to `host smtp.freemail.example' and
`user joe.smith' will show:

        Name: smtp.freemail.example
        Kind: Internet password
     Account: joe.smith
       Where: smtp://smtp.freemail.example

6 Delivery Status Notifications
*******************************

In situations such as delivery failure or very long delivery delay, the
mail system often generates a message for the sender of the mail in
question, informing him about the difficulties.

   Delivery Status Notification (DSN) requests, defined in RFC 3461,
try to give the sender of the mail control about how and when these DSN
messages are sent.  The SMTP server must support the DSN extension.
*Note Server information mode::.

   A first parameter controls when such messages should be generated:
never, on delivery failure, on delivery delay, and/or on success.  This
can be set with `dsn_notify'/`--dsn-notify', see *note
dsn_notify::/*note --dsn-notify::.

   A second parameter controls how much of the original mail should be
contained in a DSN message: only the headers, or the full mail. This
can be set with `dsn_return'/`--dsn-return', see *note
dsn_return::/*note --dsn-return::.  Note that this parameter only
applies to DSNs that indicate delivery failure for at least one
recipient. If a DSN contains no indications of delivery failure, only
the headers of the message are returned.

File: msmtp.info,  Node: Envelope-from address,  Next: Logging,  Up: Sendmail mode

7.1 Envelope-from address
=========================

The SMTP server expects a sender mail address for each mail. This is the
envelope-from address. It is independent of the From header (because it
is part of the mail _envelope_, not of the mail itself), but in most
cases both addresses are the same.

   Envelope-from addresses can be generated automatically (when
`auto_from' is enabled with the `auto_from' command or `--auto-from'
option) or set explicitly with the `from' command and `--from' option.
See *note auto_from::, *note from::.

   When `auto_from' is enabled, an envelope-from address of the form
user@domain will be generated.  The local part will be set to `USER' or,
if that fails, to `LOGNAME' or, if that fails, to the login name of the
current user.  The domain part can be set with the `maildomain' command
and `--maildomain' option (see *note maildomain::).  If the maildomain
is empty, the envelope-from address will only consist of the user name
and not have a domain part.


File: msmtp.info,  Node: Logging,  Next: Bcc header,  Prev: Envelope-from address,  Up: Sendmail mode

7.2 Logging
===========

Logging is enabled on a per account basis. If it is enabled, msmtp will
generate one log line for each mail it tries to send via the account in
question.

   The line will include the following information:
   * Host name of the SMTP server:  `host=hostname'

   * Whether TLS was used: `tls=(on|off)'

   * Whether authentication was used: `auth=(on|off)'

   * The user name used for authentication (only if authentication is
     used): `user=name'

   * The envelope-from address: `from=address'

   * The recipient addresses: `recipients=addr1,addr2,...'

   * The size of the mail as transferred to the server, in bytes (only
     if the delivery succeeded): `mailsize=number'

   * The SMTP status code and SMTP error message (only in case of
     failure and only if available): `smtpstatus=number',
     `smtpmsg='message''. Multiline SMTP messages will be concatenated
     into one line.

   * The msmtp error message (only in case of failure and only if
     available): `errormsg='message''

   * The msmtp exit code (from `sysexits.h'; `EX_OK' indicates
     success): `exitcode=EX_...'

   If a logfile is given with the `logfile' command or `--logfile'
option, this log line will be prepended with the current date and time
and appended to the specified file. See *note logfile::, *note
--logfile::.

   If syslog logging is enabled with the `syslog' command or `--syslog'
option, the log line is passed to the syslog service with the specified
facility. See *note syslog::, *note --syslog::.


File: msmtp.info,  Node: Bcc header,  Prev: Logging,  Up: Sendmail mode

7.3 Bcc header
==============

msmtp transmits mails unaltered to the SMTP server, with one exception:
the Bcc header(s) will be removed before the transmission. This
behavior can be changed with the `keepbcc' command and `--keepbcc'
option, see *note keepbcc::/*note --keepbcc::.


File: msmtp.info,  Node: Server information mode,  Next: Remote Message Queue Starting mode,  Prev: Sendmail mode,  Up: Top

8 Server information mode
*************************

In server information mode, msmtp prints as much information about the
SMTP server as it can get and then exits.

   The SMTP features that can be detected are:
   * SIZE
     The maximum message size that the SMTP server accepts.

   * PIPELINING
     Whether certain SMTP commands may be send in groups rather than
     one by one.  This can speed up mail transmission if the recipient
     list is long.  This feature is used automatically.

   * STARTTLS
     *Note Transport Layer Security::.

   * AUTH
     *Note Authentication::.

   * DSN
     *Note Delivery Status Notifications::.

   * ETRN
     *Note Remote Message Queue Starting mode::.

   If TLS is activated for server information mode, the following
information will be printed about the SMTP server's TLS certificate (if
available):
   * Owner information
        * Common Name

        * Organization

        * Organizational unit

        * Locality

        * State or Province

9 Remote Message Queue Starting mode
************************************

Remote Message Queue Starting (RMQS) is defined in RFC 1985.  It is a
way for a client to request that a server start the processing of its
mail queues for messages that are waiting at the server for the client
machine.  If any messages are at the server for the client, then the
server creates a new SMTP session and sends the messages at that time.

   msmtp can only send the request (using the ETRN SMTP command); a
mail server on the client side should then accept the connection of the
remote SMTP server to receive the mail.

   RMQS requests can be sent with the `--rmqs' option (see *note
--rmqs::).  Destinations defined in RFC 1985 are:
   * HOST
     Request the messages for the given host.

   * @DOMAIN
     Request the messages for the given domain.

   * #QUEUE
     Request the delivery of the messages in the given queue.

File: msmtp.info,  Node: Using msmtp with Mutt,  Next: Using msmtp with mail,  Prev: A user configuration file,  Up: Examples

10.3 Using msmtp with Mutt
==========================

Create a configuration file for msmtp and add the following lines to
your Mutt configuration file:
     set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp"
     set use_from=yes
     set realname="Your Name"
     set from=you@example.com
     set envelope_from=yes

   The `envelope_from=yes' option lets Mutt use the `-f' option of
msmtp.  Therefore msmtp chooses the first account that matches the from
address you@example.com. Alternatively, you can use the `-a' option:
     set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp -a my_account"

   Or set everything from the command line:
     set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp --host=mailhub -f me@example.com --tls"
   *Note Choosing an account::.

   If you have multiple mail accounts in your msmtp configuration file
and let Mutt use the `-f' option to choose one, you can easily switch
accounts in Mutt with the following Mutt configuration lines:
     macro generic "<esc>1" ":set from=you@example.com"
     macro generic "<esc>2" ":set from=you@your-employer.example"
     macro generic "<esc>3" ":set from=you@some-other-provider.example"
   Now you can use <esc>1, <esc>2, and <esc>3 to switch accounts.

   The following example uses a different approach: it maps the single
key `<tab>' in Compose context for switching between the various
account in a handy visual way. In the same Compose context, `=' is
mapped in order to show the current msmtp account. This example was
contributed by Thomas Baruchel.
     # Define <tab> and = in order to switch or see the current msmtp account
     # Don't forget to put the right path for msmtp binary
     macro compose \Cx_ ":set sendmail"
     macro compose \Cx| "\Cx_ = \"/usr/local/bin/msmtp"
     macro compose \Cx& ":macro compose \\t \\Cx"
     macro compose <tab> "\Cx0"
     macro compose = "\Cx_\n"
     # Put the account in the following lines (here three accounts)
     # Don't forget to put the number of the account at the beginning
     # of the line, and the number of the next account after the '&'
     macro compose \Cx0 "\Cx|\"\n\Cx&1\n\Cx_\n" # default and switch to 1
     macro compose \Cx1 "\Cx| -a example_account\"\n\Cx&2\n\Cx_\n" # switch to 2
     macro compose \Cx2 "\Cx| -a gmail\"\n\Cx&0\n\Cx_\n" # switch to 0
     # End of the accounts

10.4 Using msmtp with mail
==========================

Define a default account, and put the following into `~/.mailrc':
     set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp"

   You need to define a default account, because mail does not allow
extra options to the msmtp command line.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

GNU GPL
=======

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply
it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains
in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of
users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
     on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may
     convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any
     non-source form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work
     with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface
     for which an implementation is available to the public in source
     code form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including
     scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include
     the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
     associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
     shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
     is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,
     given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License
     acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
     provided by copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for
     you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
     provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
     conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
     Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
     exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on
     terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
     copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention
     to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
          as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of
          the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access
          to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated
          by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
          the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long
          as needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.


     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product
     is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or
     installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it
     has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied
     when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
     operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License
     with terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be
          marked in reasonable ways as different from the original
          version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
     conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work
     material governed by the terms of that license document, provided
     that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or
     conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under
     the third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
     licenses for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
     possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
     predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
     with reasonable efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for
     exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not
     initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
     lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making,
     using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
     portion of it.

 11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its
     contributor version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To
     "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an
     agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under
     which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of
     your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third
     party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered
     work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
     with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made
     from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
     specific products or compilations that contain the covered work,
     unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license
     was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
     simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
     pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it
     at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to
     collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
     convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
     terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying
     the Program.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
     version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.


END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read `http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html'.
